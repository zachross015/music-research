I can't think straight I can't focus. I can't work diligently. In spite of that though today was actually a fairly productive day even when it was just kind of a break, I found that instead of like flocking to entertainment or video games right away I actually decided to practice which is really cool. Not just like a casual practice, but I went and did a bunch of diligent stuff like I did swing exercises and then I did like triplet exercises and then I broke down one of the comp examples. I'm trying to learn so I'm actually really proud of myself because it's starting to really get ingrained in my mind That these things are projects that I can work on and they don't all require like high energy input to do them you know like working through the songs I can just pick a section and loop it for like 30 minutes to an hour with some mindless stuff on in the background And really go at it and just get the muscle memory good which is actually really exciting. You know like I'm happy that I'm finally at this point where I'm starting to take a lot of what I do Mohr seriously more professionally and like in preparing these things for the Internet or even for myself, I'm trying to get like a better sense of mastery I think of doing so I'm understanding a lot more of Like how to break things down and how to better work on them like with this piece. There are sections that I obviously can't play and so I'm trying to build up the skill set to play those sections well but it's like once I can play them then it's more about recording what I'm playing listening back to it and breaking down like you know what what are the actual issues that I need to work through, which seems to be working well and I read Joey's book. I wouldn't saw Noah play corn hole. You know I spend a lot of time with family and I still have this defensiveness and resistance with them but at least I was there and I tried and I'm really tired, but I don't wanna go to bed yet and I don't know if I'm just like not listening to my body. I don't think I got enough exercise, which I'm like trying to get over whatever this fucking thing is.","",0,false,Markdown

The most recent masturbations have been more like…idk. They're a lot nicer, but it's like she's clung to me the entire time. We're almost attached in this dance. I don't complain to Her as much as I just feel part of something in Her presence. But there's also a very maternal aspect to it. A lot of times I feel like I'm lying with my head in Her lap, looking up at Her and watching Her just do something else? Almost like she's carrying me around as an infant and every once in a while she pauses to coddle me, coo at me, or play with me. I think it connects a lot to the other size fantasies because I used to always imagine Her playing with me in Her shoes, with pause to scrunch me and make sure I knew she was paying attention to me even if she was doing something else like walking around. And when it's more traditional, the fantasy now is around Her riding me and pulling my head up to suck Her tits. Or kissing me repeatedly in between words.

I can learn up to 3 hours of music as early as a week in advance, and most of my prep goes into making sure that I can create the best experience possible for you, the band, and the audience. I’ll provide my own kit + mics and once I get the setlist down we’ll set up a rehearsal to make sure we're all on the same page. 

For gigs like this, my normal rate is $100 plus travel. Since it's in Athens, that would come to about $262.40 for prep, rehearsal, performance, travel, and gear. Since you're a friend, I'm knocking the performance fee in half -- so the total for everything comes out to $212.40. 

If all that sounds good, I'll block off the date and start locking in the set! Otherwise I can connect you with some other drummers that might be able to help out.","",0,false,Markdown

Had a good time actually when I wanted to like an hour and a half before a shift, I got a meditation in. I made some coffee I went to work and it was a long day at work and I think I may be pushed myself too hard afterwards I mean, I ran, which was amazing but then I also had to practice and post stuff and I don't know whenever I posted everything on social media. I just fell down this hole and then my grandparents brought me pizza which I shouldn't have eaten. I should've asked for like a salad and then I masturbated to like I guess like older stuff I didn't finish my laundry and at no point during the day have I really just sat down and dealt with emotion my back's been in pain and I felt kind of sick and it's now 10 PM when I have to work at open and I guess I'm just trying to figure out where it went wrong I think trying to practice after five really or be productive after five just kept me running I think I also didn't stop drinking caffeine until like one so that probably has something to do with everything. I'm just frustrated because I need to lose weight or I wanna lose weight and I wanna get back to her but ever since I got back from the trip, I felt a little offkilter, even though I don't really wanna go to bed yet I don't think I'd be able to fall asleep, but I also don't wanna like read her journal or do mental health stuff like I'm tired. It's like all I wanna do is watch some thing play a video game like I don't really have energy I'm not sure what I'm lacking unless it's just sleep. I feel like I'm might be avoiding something that I don't know. I feel like that's usually what it comes to whenever there's mindnumbing happening is I'll be avoiding the pain of dealing with something and right now. I don't know what that is. I feel like I'm just looking for that button to be pressed you know like because I posted a video I keep checking for views or likes or whatever or watching the video. I'm being really critical myself. I don't know I watch it and I don't think I'm good. I don't really like how it came out I think it's progress but it's still not great. I'm just I guess like all frustrating. My back hurts so bad I feel like I have to re-ground myself or re-center and I'm having a really hard time doing that because I feel like it's gonna be just painful like I wanna go to bed, but I don't wanna wake up tomorrow. I don't wanna put in the work to get inspired again or to treat myself well again or have a higher standard again and I feel like tomorrow's not gonna be any better just because I'm gonna be really tired, but I don't know that for sure I don't know. I just wanna watch something. I wanna record on my songs like Noah sent me a text today made me really happy and it was just that he always listens to the door and I think like I'm just sitting on at least an album and I'm frustrated because I don't have the money to pay people to do it. I don't have the people to want to do it with me. It's like it's something that I can't do alone and I don't know how to ask people for and I'm frustrated because I wanna grow the lessons business and I don't have energy today to do it, I've been taking a lot about like the transient nature of life recently how temporary it all is and how we only have so much time and I keep asking myself if I'm spending it wisely or if there's better things I can be doing and I always think they're better things but that's the battle with resistance is where I desire better yeah I think I pushed the boundary today and listen to myself when I should've. I pushed the boundary that was there for a reason and I'm facing the consequences of it and make a big part of it is the amount of sugar I eat from all the fucking sweet cream that I need to stop eating God I fucking hate being surrounded by people that don't give a shit about what they eat it just it all pisses me off right now because I don't feel like I'm eating that much different but I'm gaining weight in fact it feels like I'm eating better then I was before but still I'm somehow gaining. I don't know maybe I'm delusional. Maybe I'm eating poor not keeping track of it so that's probably a big part of it. I just need to make sure that I'm actually paying attention to what I eat cause it's just it's just gonna get worse if I don't like I'm not even trying to stay in budget in a lot of places this is just frustrating. It's like whenever I get into this mindset like the exact one. I'm in like all that shit goes out the window and I'm I don't know how to deal with it.

I still love that part but it's not useful right now. Also Invisible Monster can be shorter. I think the whole bridge is a bit redundant. A REALLY fun idea would be to rearrange the song so that the solo is right after the second verse, have it be really syncopated (lapse-esue) and follow a Son Clave but in a mess-with-your-head kind of way. Have that lead into final chorus that goes out with a bang. Ohh but listening to the OG I do love it, but idk contextually it also doesn't fit at all. It kinda breaks the flow, especially coming after the fucking build up. Looking back on the song though, some of the like psychological stuff is so cool. Like the transition from the main verse line to the ""I don't have the luxury..."" is like a clouded mind--with how busy it is--unveiling the shadow's thoughts. Yeah listening to it more, that bridge is so out of place
