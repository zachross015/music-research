I think it's the same outfit: hair up in a clip, white sweater, black pants, black socks, and the white sambas with red stripes. I'm realizing that (in a manner akin to meditation) it's a distraction I'm holding onto. Almost as if she is a danger to me. She's occupying mental space which could be freed up for presence. In other words, the obsession with her and focus on her, rooted in desire, takes up mental bandwidth that could've focused on living presently. Every follicle of attention given to her could be directed instead to living right here and right now, the only place that something could actually be done about it. There's no masturbating to her. Or fantasizing. And the obsession/fixation is the exact thing that makes it impossible to approach people like her. It's the exact thing that perpetuates my addiction. I have to let her go. I WANT to let her go.

The part of me that stays obsessed wants her attention, yet continues to feed off her ignorance. I can't admire her beauty, I want to own her. Do whatever I want to her. And her thank me for it. It's not belonging, it's possession. It's not love, it's obsession.

It takes almost all my willpower to resist. Like last night, I kept falling in the loop.

What is it I'm actually afraid of with her?
- that I'll act inappropriate, get on my hands and knees and crawl on the floor to lick the bottoms of her shoes, that she could want that too
- Other people finding out my attraction to her
- Her finding out and ruining the fantasy
- Trying and failing, approaching her to talk and not being able to sit with the discomfort or make adequate conversation 
- That I won't win her
- That she'll bring my fantasy to life and torture me for pleasure
- Thatshe won't notice me and I'll die, she won't pay attention to me
- That I have nothing to offer her
- I see her and see someone too good for me. Someone prideful who knows they're too good for me. Someone that will dismiss me knowing their own importance and finding no value in me. It cuts deeper than the surface qualities of being a barista and a musician. I fear that I need her attention and affirmation to be worth anything and that I'm nothing without her
I felt fear and terror up until she left, made eye contact and said goodbye to her. If that's the case with all women, it's no wonder I'd always felt so scared or intimidated by approaching them. There's gotta be something deeper to understand here. What is it?

I feel like the more I look around, the more the fear and attachment exists around all attractive women. When I go into a room that's full of them, I feel an overload of danger. Even right now, I'm trying to come down, but all of the thoughts coming up surround her and what I want her to do to me.

Like I understand there's no away around it. I have to feel it and live through it, but I would give anything right now to bend her over and cum inside herself. It feels like I'm resisting some aspect of it though and that's where I feel confused. Like underneath there's something else

But I feel like I have to start asking myself why I hold myself to this state. It's not a high energy, in fact I think it sits at a level of shame. Seemingly the only way to get these things is to let them go from the mind, surrender them. It's holding onto that horny energy that makes it impossible to actually get anything

I guess at this point I just want to understand what it is I'm so afraid of. It's a guttural feeling. Like a sheer terror that I need to monitor.
- Abandonment?
- My own insignificance?
Whatever it is keeps me focused on myself, and I can feel the depths of the energy it drains in both my back and gut.

But it's also about internalizing time to a degree that you're always conscious of where the pulse is supposed to be. So if you're playing a triplet that lands on the beat at the last note (as is common in jazz) it's about knowing and internalizing where all those other notes are to land. And in addition, it's about internalizing the groove and time (along with what's being played) enough for those things to become secondary to the language and the story. To stop thinking about time and notes and instead get to a point where you're just playing emotion. I think that's why playing a groove (especially modifications on it) is so important to get consistent, because each modifier is like exploring and becoming consistent with an extension of the core, so that when playing live, whatever the mind wants to manifest will come in the exact right time","",0,false,Markdown

I think the addiction to ChatGPT is creating pains again, because I've spent the past couple days in this haze of anxiety. Part of it feels like directionless? I'm still insecurity at its core. But also misalignment.

But first: I've been so fucking brave recently. I went out with Russ and his friends last night and we played some great games. Then today, I showed up at the run club. Met up with Mayor and Danny, then we merged with a group of 8 PEOPLE. Holy shit. And we all became friends by the end of the 9 miles! One of the guys minored in jazz studies, and I spent a while talking with him about music. It was great. There's a really cute girl in the group too, getting her PhD. They're all GT grad students. Afterwards, they invited me into a WhatsApp groups and want to keep up with me (and vice versa). It's incredible how much community grows by just showing up. Being natural.

Being around these people makes me want a better life. It's nice feeling this kind of support from them.

I still feel weird though. Like I'm trying too hard to understand the dynamics of conversation, and meanwhile I'm doing so in a way that doesn't feel totally aligned. I find myself asking ""who am I in this moment"" or ""what's my dynamic in this group"" which feel like the wrong thing to be asking. In some ways it feels like by fitting in, I'm abandoning my own morals and positioning. It feels like I used to be a lot more curious and supportive, but now I just feel numb. Like I don't even care. But I think it also comes out as projection, because I hate talking about myself. I'm afraid to talk about what I do, even with people who have no suggestive nature in mind. I imagine people not caring, or worse arguing on it. And I feel insecure. It feels like at any point I could be cast out, and made to be the loner again. Like I face a constant instability 

It feels like this in some way connects to withdrawals and also rest. Like I feel numb for the most part. Not really drawn to masturbating. I look at women's feet out of habit but there's no stimulus. But I'm averting my gaze, trying not to be weird or creepy with women again. Or really with anyone. I feel insignificant in a way I haven't felt since i was masturbating. Like I'm driven towards being small again and have lost the bold edge. And in joining new groups, I keep looking for ways to shapeshift into something. Become a missing part or a leader or somehow find a way to become significant to the people so I can feel secure again. Indispensable. I'm so used to being the one that everyone loves, which means something completely different for every group, and now I'm lost trying to figure out what that means for the three different communities I've now become a part of. All the while, what I really want is just to be myself. And I haven't even really been listening lately.

And I think while all this is happening, the addictions are trying to find new outlets. Like reckless spending and desires that can only be satiated by overextending my resources either through overeating, overspending. Everything else comes from constantly trying to manage other peoples image of me, having it live up to the lofty goals I want to set for myself without being seen in the interim ","",0,false,Markdown

Two new articles:
- Eat the Grape
- How long can you tolerate a cold shower?

I feel like most the time when I ask myself what it is I need, it's invariably rest. Like that feeling of tension in my spine is a note of either integration or recalibration. I'd really like to spend the rest of the day practicing, resting, then checking in with myself and relaxing.
