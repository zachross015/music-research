Feathering the bass drum is a concept created in the early ages of Jazz.

In the early days, pulse of the song was dictated between the Tuba and the Bass
drum in the rhythm section. Because of the limited dexterity of the Tuba, the
bass drum was played on 1 & 3 while tuba was 2 & 4. Later along the line, the
upright bass started to overtake the tuba as the bass in the rhythm section.
Because of the increased dexterity, The upright would play on all four beats.
The role of the bass drum at this point became less about maintaining the pulse
as much as it was used to marry the bright, metallic sound of the swinging ride
to the woody sound of the upright bass. In essence, it was used to contrast the
metallic with the wood by creating a bridge between the two by acting as an
undercurrent. 

Feathering is done by lightly ghosting the bass drum on each quarter note. The
player should take great care to make sure the ride cymbal is well synchronized
with the bass at this point, which can be done by practicing it much louder and
reducing the volume once they are synced.

Earlier drummers like Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, and Max Roach would often play
the bass drum much louder than more Bebop-era drummers would. Jim Chapin said
the reasoning for this was that most early jazz drummers didn't trust the
bassists and so developed a strong foot to maintain control of the tempo.
