I don't even know where to begin today. So I've been thinking alot about dullness in #meditation and it's become more apparaent to me what dullness is.  It's this nmbing of the sense, and I think the reason I got so tripped up in my meditations for so long was that I had confused dullness with the meditative joy that the book talks about but now it seems obvious that I have no idea what meditative joy is and with all the other strife in my life it's hard to find any joy in anything I'm doing at all which is this incredibly frustrating state to be in because I have such a desire to learn more about Afro Cuban drumming, especially the Bembe among other beautiful drumming styles but I don't feel like I'm getting anyhwer part of that is beause my obsidian files have become this clusterfuck of insight and awareness spread throughout the day but nothing in there is ever made to form any kind of logical cohesiveness and it's all frustrating.

I've been listening to Duke Ellington and Coltrane the past day or so and I think I'm starting to pick up on the differences of drum styles but especially genres that emerged from JAzz. Their style seems to be much more mellow which makes me wonder how much their style was geared towards speakeasy crowds or if that was something that even happened during their time? I know Duke was like a founding father of Jazz along with Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton but that's about the extent of my knowledge like did they know it was called Jazz or "Jass" at the time or were they so in the ground floor that they couldn't possibly know? I also had listened to alot of the ragtime origins of Louis Armstrong (I think?) and I think he was also a founding father? I'm not entirely certain. Something about Cotton Club and Milton's Club both are prominent. Like Milton's Club was this space where they would challenge each other with Jazz via speed and modulation constantly and weird licks. I listened to some other drummers playing and I still can't differentiate the lot of them but all I know is I really dislike any of the avant garde work Max Roach did with that one saxophone player except some of the solos when you get to exactly the right spot are pretty good I feel like to reallly understand the differences between alot of these drummers the most important thing for me tod o is just actually learn their parts. I want to explore all this so much more like whene idd the eras begin and end? Who were the prominent players of each era? Prominent rummers? How did the drummers affect and inpire one another? It all to me is so fucking confusing right now and it's like I'm excited to learn more about all of itt but I'm also scared to learn about it all because it's like what if I do become knowledgeable and put this insane expectation on myself to make something of it? Like I'm already starving for time but I feel like to become more efficient at practice and more inspired means doing this kind of study, even if it means playing drums less. Like this is why I need to get out of Starbucks because carving time into my schedule for both practice and progress in physical and mental capacitices requires so much time.

It's like I feel like I need to divide my schedule further and further. I don't even know what the ideal is. Like I guess to begin with I want 3 hours a day of dilligent drum practice (ideally more but that's a start that's achieveable) and then 2 hours of exercise and then 1 hour of meditation, then the riest of the day for what ever else but what even else is there? Like is it better to do 6 hours of practice and have 3 of those be set aside for knowledge aquisition?  And where does work come into play? Is it possible to get to a point where I have some kind of self-autonomous business suite that allows me to just grow and essentially market my skills by just posting random shit? Like what I'm constantly seeing right now is I'm marketing without a product which is the worst business method in the book, there's absolutely nothing to sell which makes it hard to motivate myself to continue putting effort towards any kind of social media work because it's fruitless I mean I do also genuinely want to help people and I think this is where it all wraps together like having 3 hours for research IS a form of business management, like if I can start out with this core package that allows me to teach and move it towards a fully autonomous online lesson plan and then have 1 student a day each week, that would be this like perfect balance where I get to gig if I want to but in the meantime I could spend hours but bettering myself as a musician and bettering my mind to teach people better and I guess I don't always have the best intentions it's frustrating and I think the final part I want to hit on is that I feel like I'm forcing myself to have MONTHS of research into a subject in order to feel qualified, but if I just take it one week, one day at a time and use this method I've come up with with ChatGPT, then it's possible that month of research can be done in a week. It's all just bringing out high school insecurity.

Who drummed for Duke?

Ohh wow, Louis Bellson did in the 1950's. That's quite the connection. I wonder what tracks he played on. But before that it was Sonny Greer from 1924-1951 and after that was some other guys. The big hit with Louis Bellson was "Skin Deep." I feel like the more I look into the history of drummers, Louis Bellson was the original metal drummer, Gene Krupa Pop, and Buddy Rich was Jazz.

Is it worth doing all this in OBsidian if I implement some sort of review process?

I think the system I want to start off by trying is: - Brain dump each day - Summarize at end of day - Move to topics end of week

Additioanlly, would be really good if I could just take a day to explore qhatever I want to explore.

Really want to get a vintage gramophone and old jazz records to get the real experience 

The solution to finding a recording location where I won't disturb anyone is to just to it at an axclusive all trails location

Saying someone's name creates this immediately noticeable impression on them, but it also creates this genuine feeling of connection within. I've noticed this a lot at Starbucks where customers that I learned the name of would immediately start opening up to me--within the first couple of visits--about their life outside. It also created this much easier way of opening up to them in return. #insight

Still really neeed a water filter and trekking poles

I think my main difficulty in creating a new system is like segmentation.  Trying to differentiate the daily discussions from the more SOC influx. 

I feel like I was sent on this like recovery mission by God today. Like side quests keep popping up that I want to do, but I have no willpower to deny what this body wants to do. There's a lot of emotions present and I don't know what any of them mean. But I'm also so hungry
