# Week 25 Summary

This is a dual week. Was on vacation for the week of 25, so took the week off from any virtual journaling. There's way too much journaling from week 24, due to an obsessive compulsion with "documenting" as a means of avoiding the pain. I'm going to wait to finish this until after I have found my center again, because doing so without being centered feels like I may be moving towards something that isn't rooted in myself.
