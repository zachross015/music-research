My reaction right now to all the revelations is visceral. I can't stop shaking.

Can probably hold the newsletter off until I actually have an audience?

Desperately need today to be a nothing day

I think I'm beginning to realize that holding the tempo I'm moving at means having a fulll rest day AND a full planning day

Riding with my family to pick up Joe. There's been so much brain fog recently. I think it's sleep deprivation. Also lack of willpower. It's been noticeable today that I really need a break. I figure tomorrow, do the review then take a proper rest day. It's always hard though with like meditation and knee workouts and drum practice. It's always so fucking hard to rationalize a break when I have all these things to working on. Like two weeks in a row of little progress for my PT feels awful. Then a week hardly meditating. Gah, it fucking sucks. And it's like I stacked this blog post on too tomorrow. I need an actual break to slow down and smell the roses. But now that I'm on all opens again, it's hard to get anything. 

I just wanna cry. Especially with all the revelations from today. I had this like full body shakedown after I masturbated. It felt so shameful, but it also felt necessary. Like I was going through something. Trying to understand why. Like I'm getting defensive again. Controlling even. Like that part of me that comes out in relationships is coming out everywhere. It's anger. It's depression. It's frustration. It's like, why can't I just be happy with my partner? Would Brandi actually make for a good teammate if I was a healthy person? I think she posted something with me yesterday and took it down. Instagram said she posted something that's no longer available. Am I looking too far into it? I'm so confused. It's like I don't even have the conscious level of thought required to analyze this issue. Maybe the brain fog is protecting me from a truth? I'm scared. I don't understand the narrative with Her here. Like why the progressive objectification? Why do I want so badly to strip her of all she is? It reminds me of that arc id written for Soulscape for Zaros. He was a brash, funny, disrespectful character. But he was kidnapped, held captive, and had his mouth sewn shut. Eventually they wore him down until he was a lifeless soldier. Like I get trying to objectify her. But why the progression? Why do I want her to resist it and slowly whittle her away? Why does that manifest as rejecting her? Why do I want her to be lifeless? What is all of this protecting me from? God, what is the purpose of all of this?

Feet don't have nearly the same appeal anymore

Yeah I'm starting to realize how little my family actually listens. I talked a bit about how Alex is writing yacht rock and my mom only said "ohh good for them." Fucking bitch. 

For the niche stuff, is it better to let the niche arise naturally as a consequence of who I am, or do I put research into it?

And all the insecurities are making me want to resolve back into the loan wolf, trading contributions to the group for self preservation

It's almost like all the fantasies I've had where I'm the victim of being used and abused were this way of being okay with wanting to do the same thing to someone else.
