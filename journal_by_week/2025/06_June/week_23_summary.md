## Goals

No goals were established for the week. No weekly review was done. Mainly due to the depth of attachment issues discovered from the week before. 

## Summary

The week opened with the sadistic brat rising—reframing the dynamic as a power trip and pulling me into fantasies that blurred truth and desire. I saw how much I craved not just her body, but control over her mind. Beneath it all was a lifetime of shame—shame for who I wanted to be and who I was forced to become. Love had become entangled with punishment, manipulation the only language I knew for expressing emotion. When I learned she was dating someone new, it broke me—but it also cracked something open. I spoke to God again about what I truly want: not dominance, not fantasy, but something tender, rooted in feeling rather than fear. That was when I uncovered the deeper wound—attachment severed at birth—and the somatic collapse that followed left me shaking for an entire day.

In its wake, I began seeing my own patterns more clearly: the ways I manipulated her through jealousy, silence, control—how I abandoned transparency to protect myself from rejection, only to breed pain and obsession. Her new relationship mirrored insecurities I hadn’t faced—about love, career, and worth. Still, small triumphs surfaced: I asked to be paid for a gig, and felt the quiet dignity of self-created value; I asked for help and received it. I saw how I’ve built relationships on giving all of myself to avoid detachment—equating it with death—and how that’s made regulation impossible, breakups catastrophic. Now I see how my projections have tainted her, and every impulse to manipulate is shadowed by guilt. But that awareness feels like a beginning.

## Good Things

- Began to decouple sado-masochism and witness it rather than indulge
- Took first real steps to moving past attachment issues, despite their pain
- Valued myself for the first time and began to see how addictive it feels to *create* value.

## Problems

- I think I got 3 hours of dilligent practice total
- Obsession, attachment issues, and identity displacement caused me to frequently disregard myself, my dog, and my family. There was 2 meditations, almost no goo meal prep, 2 days of dilligent exericse, and a massive addiction to video games
- All of the focus was on her this week. I lost myself completely. It was almost like my entire focus was on retaining her. This brought out so many attachment issues. 
- Masturbating to the sadistic things didnt actually help. It really just hurt. Only when I did it from a consensual place did it feel good.
- Masturbation addiction
- Ate like shit
- Even during dilligent practices, had absolutely no focus on what I was doing
- Almost no progress on website, which is needed to launch career forward
- No tiktoks, blog post, or newsletter like I had hoped to complete

## The Overall Issue

The overall issue was rooted in attachment issues. Despite all the pain and suffering I endured this week, I think I actually made alot of progress on identifying the issues. There was alot of deep digging and somatic release. There was much more perspective than ever before. I have begun to realize that the killed-at-birth narrative has deeply impacted all of my relationships and probably affects emotional regulation to an extent, having been forced into so many places where I didn't feel like I belonged made it hard for me to connect and taught me that love comes from an authority telling you "I love you so you have to do this," the persistent pain and suffocation I felt in relationships manifested as pain which I used as "love" for my partners, and the KAB narrative has caused me to view detachment as a form of death which has made me frequently give up all parts of my identity to keep attachments alive. That last one is the most important part and the solution: stop giving yourself up for others.

## Solution

No more giving yourself up. There are plenty of ways to be loving and express yourself without losing yourself in the other person.
