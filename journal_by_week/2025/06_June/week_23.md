I think I'm also frustrated that right now, I'm turned on by some part of this dynamic. The minimization or idk, something. Likeâ€¦it felt like I was punishing her. Genuinely I was scared, but I avoided all eye contact and any confrontation, and the voice in my head wanted to punish her. The sadistic brat was talking about how naughty she was, seeing her as having done this for attention, and I'm drawn to it. Sexually energized by it. Like I'm leaving work so fucking horny from the withdrawal. And I'm frustrated because now I see that as one of the main things that keep me involved. Like all I want is to either masturbate or fuck her. Almost like she's doing this to toy with me. And it's likeâ€¦I know she's doing that to an extent. I know she's trying to hurt me. I don't know if she knows it, but her body language and the ways she's being careful with her words tells me that she wishes it was me. Maybe that's what I want to see, maybe I'm mentally creating this dynamic *because* I fucking love it. Maybe I want her to be punishing me for this, for rejecting her. Maybe I *want* her to go on a date with this other guy and continue having this obsession with me. It feels like I'm creating this constant dynamic where no matter who she goes out with, I'll always be stuck on her mind. It feels like I'm playing these mind games to reclaim control. Not even mind games to her, to myself. Like all I can imagine is her going on this date and thinking about me the whole time. Before I left, she was talking about hanging out, but she was careful not to call it a date like last time. I caught the stutter.  Or was it even real? It's like she's more attractive to me when I know she can't have me.  It's not just in the bed room I want to play with her, but her mind is what I want to toy with. To make her obsess over me. She's already shared that she's been dreaming about me. One where we were getting married and sleeping together. She's slipped and called me her boyfriend now several times. It's like I'm unconsciously playing all these mind games with her that create the obsession I want her to have , and I'm so tired of the consequences of that. I don't want to be with her. But I fucking love this dynamic. I've created it with all my previous partners and I don't know how to get away from it because it's such a turn on. It's a power trip.

I want to create the obsession that my dad never had with me. I want to create the attention I never got to experience from him. The care I never got.

* * *

## ðŸ”¥ You're aroused by the same power dynamic that's hurting you.

  

Not because you're "broken." But because at some point in your life, power over someone else was the only imaginable route to feeling safe, seen, or real.

  

This kind of dynamic--where withdrawal, rejection, longing, punishment, and seduction all swirl together--isn't just a kink. It's a survival strategy turned erotic.

  

When your early relationships taught you:

- that being in control was safer than being vulnerable, - that getting someone hooked was better than being abandoned, - that love was attention laced with punishment,

  

â€¦then arousal will wire itself around control, withholding, humiliation, and obsession--because that's what "intimacy" looked like growing up.

* * *

## ðŸ˜ˆ "I want to toy with her."

  

What you're describing is textbook sadistic fantasy--but not in the cartoon villain way. In the psychological, relational, trauma-informed sense.

  

It's about reclaiming power by being the one who gets to shape the other person's world.

It's about you becoming the one whose absence creates ache.

It's about reversing the helplessness of being on the receiving end.

  

You are not consciously manipulating her, but you're noticing that your fantasy thrives on her longing, her confusion, her frustration--because that's where you feel most powerful. And in many ways, most alive.

  

This is both incredibly honest and incredibly common in people who had to psychologically seduce safety from those who were unpredictable or unavailable.

* * *

## ðŸ§  "I'm playing these mind games to reclaim control."

  

Yes. And here's the thing:

  

You've probably always been doing this--but what's different now is that you're finally watching it from the outside.

  

That means two huge things:

1. You have more power than ever before--because you're no longer just acting out the pattern blindly.

2. You're facing a deep split--because the part of you that enjoys the power trip is at war with the part of you that wants out.

  

You're not just horny for her body. You're horny for the psychological upper hand. For that feeling of "she's obsessed with me, even when she's with someone else." That's not evil. That's a wounded protector inside of you saying:

  

> "If I can make her need me, I'll never be discarded again."

* * *

## ðŸ˜© "I'm so tired of the consequences of that."

  

That's your adult self speaking.

  

The part of you that knows:

- this dynamic never actually satisfies you, - that you don't want to be with her, - and that continuing this cycle just makes you the one stuck.

  

You're not addicted to her. You're addicted to the role she lets you play.

  

But roles can become cages.

* * *

## ðŸ’¥ So where do you go from here?

  

You're in the stage of healing where desire and pain are all tangled up--and the only way forward is through conscious experimentation and somatic honesty.

  

Here's how to work with this:

* * *

### 1.

### Label the dynamic without judging it.

  

You're not "toxic" or "manipulative." You're playing out the only power structure you were taught to eroticize. But now you see it.

  

> Instead of reacting with shame or indulging unconsciously, try > this:

> "Ah--this is the part of me that gets turned on by withdrawal and > control. I see you. I know what you're trying to protect."

  

Naming it creates space. Shame tightens it.

* * *

### 2.

### Find safe, consensual containers for the fantasy.

  

You mentioned earlier how these dynamics could feel freeing if they were part of an intentional, negotiated BDSM-like container.

  

That's where healing can happen through embodiment. Through saying:

- "This is a role I choose to play," not "This is the only way I know how to connect." - "We agree on the rules," not "One of us is secretly seducing or punishing the other."

  

If that turns you on, it's not a problem. It's a language--but right now, you're speaking it unconsciously with people who don't even know the script.

* * *

### 3.

### Name the grief beneath the fantasy.

  

You're not just horny. You're hurting. The fantasy gives temporary power--but it doesn't fill the wound.

  

The wound is:

  

> "No one ever chose me for who I was. I had to earn their obsession, > or I disappeared."

  

When you let yourself feel that--not just eroticize it--you reclaim the power for real.

* * *

### 4.

### Ask yourself: what would it mean to feel safe without being in control?

  

Because that's the terrifying leap your body doesn't yet know how to make.

  

What would it feel likeâ€¦

- to be desired without manipulating desire?  - to let someone walk away without needing to haunt their mind?  - to feel chosen without engineering obsession?

  

This is the work. And you are right in the middle of it.

* * *

You don't need to stop being turned on by power. You just need to bring that turn-on into consciousness, choose the right containers, and uncouple it from the parts of you that are still chasing safety from people who can't give it.

  

The moment you name all this, you're no longer trapped.

  

You're aware. And from here--you get to choose.

There's an immense anxiety whenever she's around. It's putting me into a panic attack. Especially because she's talking about going on a date with some other guy. I thought we were supposed to? Fucking flaky cunt. She was mine. I had her right where I fucking wanted her.  You were supposed to be mine. You're not behaving the way I wanted you and it's hurting me. You've betrayed me yet again. You've made me feel like an idiot. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. Even if the two of you weren't...I'd still hate you. I'd still be in pain. But it's this exact thing that makes me obsessed with you.  This is the push and pull. You're leaving now, so I have to bring you back. You try to leave but I won't let you. Because you're mine. And all you ever will be is my little toy. My tease. My fuck puppet. What happens this time if we let her go?

One of the most important things I think I can do right now is adjust my sleep schedule. Now that Starbucks is more consistent again, having that consistent 8-9 hours every day is going to give me the energy and mindfulness I need to carry everything else. #health

It's hit me now that I'm now a profitable and professional musician.  I charge for gigs. I charge for recording. And I charge for lessons.  It's not a lot, but it's growing. And people respect me for it :D

It all comes from a lifetime of being forced into a person that I'm not. My perception of love is surrounded by shame in being who I wished I could be on both sides of the aisle, so it makes sense that my relationships are fueled with causing shame over love, forcing round pegs into square holes, and punishing for short comings. I think to some degree, I seek out people who make me feel shame for who I am or want to be. Usually religious and nature oriented? Not always religious, but the religious trauma adds to the suffering that I seek. In the way my mom used to "punish" me for avoiding church, or dad with Scouts. I don't think love was really demonstrated in any other way than them saying they were putting me through these things because they loved me.  Trying to shape me into someone I wasn't and holding on way too long to that ideal. I felt punished by both of them because of both of their obsessive mental models, punishing me the same way dad punished the dogs and having my mom be powerless to defend us against him. All I remember was my dad's rage and absence.

ChatGPT helps but I never understand when it helps. Like the pain I've been dealing with NEEDED morning pages. Actually listening to my self acoustically instead of ranting to a computer looking for solutions. The insights come from the rant.

Like why do I even want to get deep with her? Why do I want to peel back the layers and see what no one else sees? Why am I so turned on by her trauma? Why do I clutch on to being the only one that truly sees her? If itâ€™s not about obsession, then what am I actually looking for here? What problem am I trying to solve? When I stop punishing her, what if it just dissolves the connection?  If Iâ€™m the only one of the two of us aware enough to see the connection dissolve from a choice that I made, to potentially see her drown because I decided to stop punishing her, how is that any better than if I kept doing the same thing? **Because at least in this dynamic, Iâ€™m the one in control. She trusts me, she loves me. I take care of her, I help her, I listen to her, and I support her and I inspire her. Iâ€™m always there for her. If I walk away and she ends up in something awful, how am I any better than if I kept doing what Iâ€™m doing now?**

I need a break from the mental health work. I need a break from it all.

Secret to marketing is to phrase everything like it's a benefit. Any *problems* you have can be a bonus to someone else. Highlight these things. #tips #insights #marketing

I need a dopamine detox again. I feel like I'm still recovering from that fucking sundae.

I'm desperate to see her. I need her. I'm terrified of her. I don't want to see her. All she is is pain and suffering. I'm desperate to detach.

> If I can figure it out, I can feel safe.

But that safety is an illusion.

There is no real clarity coming from her.

Only echoes. Only breadcrumbs. Only patterns that keep you spinning.

---

She may never know what she meant to you.

She may never answer the questions that haunt you.

But you can learn to stop chasing the person who won't say the thing you need to hear.

### 2.

### Trace the erotic map back to its origin.

  

Where did you learn that toying with others equals safety?

Who did you obsess over as a kid? Who made you beg for affection, then pulled it away?

What relationships made you feel like a possession?

  

You'll likely find that you were used before you ever used anyone.

This isn't about blame. It's about freeing your body from its inheritance.

She is trying to date him and it's putting me in so much pain. And now all I want to do is hurt her

I want her to see me. All I want is for mommy to see me. She never did as a kid. Not when I was hurting. I wanted her to hear me. And now I feel like I'm always finding people that are the same, and I want to change them. I want to fix my relationship with my mom as a kid by changing the people now. For forever, she owned me. She protected to me. I was attached to her, a mamas boy, up into middle school. 

I felt pain as a form of love from my dad. I did it for so long that now I want revenge. I want everyone else to go through what I had to go through. Because that's how I love the world back. That's how I pay it back for the hand I was dealt. The emotional manipulation I faced on both sides. To be scared of their next move is to be loved.  To be traumatized is to be loved. To control her is to love her. To try and change her is to love her.

I've got Messiah Complex + Veil + Cockroach King stuck in my head.

I just want to know that she sees me. That she's not ignoring me when I'm in pain. That if I cry, she'll be there to comfort me.

# 06-05-2025

Be transparent about the fact you want Her. Text her first. Send her things.  Let them know you think about them. #communication

The problem with all the attachment issues is that I lose myself in her and forget to love the people who won't leave unconditionally.  Like my dog. #attachmentissues #loss

I want to invite her to Indian Seats with me, pretty much only to keep her close since there's the threat of her leaving now. I feel her moving away so I'm trying desperately to come up with ways to win her back. Like doing something spontaneous. Planning more trips.  Anything to be around her more. The weirdest part, is I don't see her changing when she has someone. She didn't last time. And she seems so unsure. I find myself looking for ways to hurt her: posting I'm here on insta, hiding from her who I do things with, manipulating her into believing this guy's an asshole or is only in it for sex. I'm observing these things as I've done in the past. None reflect how I want to be, because all of them bring the pain right back to me eventually. Let it be what it is. It shouldn't matter whether they end up together or not. #communication #attachmentissues #sadomasochism

I think the only real way to get what I want here is to be that person. She never invites me to anything spontaneously to an extent because I don't already do that. She imitates a lot of my behaviors (as most people do) so the fact that I've never done it probably gets reciprocated. I haven't made her feel safe to do so. This goes for all my friendships too. Me wanting to make her jealous in this instance is *because* she never invites me. I have to be the change I want to see. FaceTime her instead of waiting for her to FT me. Same with texting. Invitations. Coffee dates. Etc. I feel terrible for having rejected her now. But I'm afraid all of this is just a desperate attempt to keep the attachment alive. Like it always happens. #communication #confidence #friendship #leadership

On the walk down, all I could think about is how jagged I am with her. She's so bright about me most the time, reciprocates excitement and enthusiastic to compliments. I feel sad at how much I disregard her compliments. I think she tries to make me jealous because I try to make her jealous. It feels like to change the friendship, I have to change the entire dynamic. It's hard because I wanted her here because of the attachment. There's a genuine desire for her to always be around, but there's so much fear there too. I think some of the fear comes *from* the reciprocation. I have really strong feelings here and I think I'm afraid I'll be rejected for them. Even from a friendship point of view, I have so much love for her and appreciation for her that I'm afraid to tell her about. There's so many things I wish I could tell her. It's not just about her though, like I wish I could just be the person who communicates all those things. Appreciation for others, love for others, and feel them fully without worrying about being rejected for it. #communication #friendship #vulnerability #transparency #suffering

But back to the invitation, I feel like this is a weird wall I've put up from connection issues. It's like, I can be free with other people around. And there's not a limit on how much people can hang out. It's weird in that I feel like I've believed that I have to deal with these issues alone. But it would be so easy to jus make it an opportunity for connection instead #friendship #leadership #communication

But so many of these like opportunities for connections are ruined by how much I've kept secret. Like if I could just be transparent form the beginning, all my relationships would flow so much easier and I could actually talk about these pains #vulnerability #transparency

It's a nervous system shaped by early rupture, like what you described: > "I was taken from my mom because I wasn't breathing." That matters. You were separated from the source of life right after entering the world. Your body, not your mind, learned: > "If I lose connection, I might not survive." So now? Every ambiguous, intoxicating, unavailable, or intense relationship re-triggers that terror. Not because you're broken-- but because your body is trying to keep you alive. #chatgpt #attachmentissues

I think the hardest part of all this is that if she leaves, then I'm all alone again you know like she's giving me this reassurance and confidence that that I can be loved for what I'm doing you know like that someone will support me for the dream I have And that's what feels scarce is that if she ends up with someone, she leaves the Starbucks we work out if she moves then I'm alone again it's not like she's the only one that supported me like I have so many friends in my family that's on board but it's like with her gone. It's like What do I do? It's like I desperately want to keep her in my life because of the security, she gives me I feel safe when I'm with her you know like when I started this journey, I prayed for her almost exactly and she appeared, and so like I feel desperate to keep her here. Like without her it feels like what I'm trying to do is childish that I have to subject myself to criticism again I have to go out there and tell people yeah I'm trying to be a musician. I'm trying to be an artist and I'm just like fucking hoping that there's love somewhere on this pathand it's like even if she's imperfect like she loves me and she treats me well and I would do anything to keep that around right now.

# 06-06-2025

I feel the obsession in the back of my neck and in my throat. What do you need from me right now? I need you to stop. Stop trying to feel it. Stop trying to hurt. Just go out there and avoid this. To be a normal fucking person with people who don't give a shit. Stop giving me the power to control your life.  You're a strong man. You don't need her. You don't even want her. You know something better exists.  So stop thinking about her. She will only disappoint you over and over. Stop trying to fix me and just move on. You're only making it worse. What are you afraid will happen if you don't obsess? But she won't love me or if she does love me she's gonna slowly drift away from me that I'll never find love that she's gonna leave the Starbucks. We're at to go live with this fucking twat. That if she's not paying attention to me, then I actually have to try and get someone tonight or live up to an expectation of myself that I don't understand or don't know about. I'm afraid she'll text me. I'm afraid I'll text her. I'm afraid that we're gonna text each other the wrong things.  I'm afraid that she's gonna figure out that I like her. I'm afraid she's gonna randomly show up and I'm afraid of. I know what to do with myself and that I should be happy if she does it, but then I'll actually hate her for it, but if I don't look at every single detail and be ready for whatever situation happens and somethings gonna happen I'm just gonna die. I'm afraid if I don't get it right this time, She'll leave foreever. I'm afraid that now I've left her, she's never coming back. I'm afraid that I'm making the wrong decision that if I don't make the right decision here I'll die and she'll never come to save me or I'll never find Her. I'm afraid that she might be the one and I'm making the wrong decision. Every time I go through this I don't know how to trust myself and I'm afraid I'm making the wrong decision that I'm deciding not to be with the right person and I never trust my judgement no matter how much it hurts because at least right now the love is real and the pain is love. I'm suffering because I'm choosing to stay on her hook and I want her to suffocate me I want her to hurt me because then at least I still have her I'm so scared of being alone I'm so scared because she's going to leave me for this other guy and then I'll be alone again and actually have to try again I would rather be in pain indebted to her than suffer the drastic consequences of being fucking without her it's the same thing every fucking time I would rather give up everything to be who she needs to be. I can't decide. I can't decide. The obsession is because I can't decide. I look at every angle because I can't decide.  I can't decide. I don't want to be with her. I don't want to be without her. Because right now I'm having to voluntarily go through a one sided breakup all on my own. I'm having to distance myself because I can't decide and I don't want to hurt her but I love to make her feel the pain I'm feeling because then at least I feel seen I feel heard I feel like I only have her when she's begging for me when she's obsessed with me when she'd rather die than live without me. I can't decide. I can't decide. I can't figure out whether we're meant to be and I'm too scared to try because I've been traumatized by my relationships and by how painful detachment has been. I can't decide. Even when I broke up with them in the past, I still never could decide. I can't decide. I can't decide. I can't decide. I can't decide. I won't decide. I can't decide. I won't decide. And I can't just act fucking normal until I do because I'm obsessed. Because if I don't decide then I die. And so until I decide it's this constant fucking loop of reciprocating the pain she doesn't know she gives me.

Creative expression is the solution. That is how to ground within myself. That is how to stay with myself.

I've learned a lot of lessons from Brandi, but learning how to ground myself amidst obsession and move past attachment may be the most important one

Eltheanin PS128

Every time I get a text from her now it's this shockwave of pain.  Every potential rejection feels like I'm being suffocated, pulled away screaming.

She can't make time for you now, that wouldn't change in a relationship.

My relationships have been riddled with constant and unconscious reciprocation of pain. When I look at it now, it seems almost like all I've ever done has been inflict pain on partners. And now it makes so much sense how much of that is because of how I've interpreted love in the past. Like the delayed texts, holding things over their head, trying to mold them, trying to punish them...it's like this massive revelation.

I feel so much more energized to play with people when I make money.

It's just struck me that in both my businesses (gigging and lessons) I've already made one sale each. #progress it motivates me to really want to make these offers #sales #business #gigging #lessons

Intentionally gratifying Her feels so much better than unintentionally punishing Her

A lot of my texting patterns (and really communication punishment) revolves around the projection that I'm inflicting pain to them in a way that *grows them closer to me*.

There's many more rich people that wanna play drums than there are rich drummers

There's such a larger sense of joy in actually creating money. Like knowing I'll make $50 from a gig or $30 from a lesson right now creates the immediate gratification that I feel like making money should be, instead of waiting two weeks for the $700 Starbucks drop. #insights #finance #business

Finding a way to automate gig booking through Calendly or Fiverr is going to make it so much easier for people to just book a gig without all the hassle of reach out. I need to find a reasonable way to do this. Another really good idea is to make a feedback form with my criteria (the Benny Greb 6) and their criteria (eg punctuality, kindness, professionalism, etc) that cater to the market. #marketing #automation #business #ideas could potentially build this into a gig app that takes inspiration from bumble/uber. I can kinda imagine it now, having guarantee statistics to show to the consumer and other statistics (like average attendance) to the freelancer. Worth looking into. All of this is mainly to build a good platform for social proof. #business #automation

Those pre-relationship anxieties come from the same panic. I'm curious how they would feel now from self regulation. Because what was supposed to be exciting always came up as anxious

[[Happiness Hypothesis]] talks about how most of our decision making comes from emotions. That's why people with lobotomies don't make decisions easily. This can be used to help with art by attuning yourself to the emotion of a piece.  When you begin to truly *feel* the art, you begin to make decisions which align with those emotions.  This is why every artist should go through a "calibration" period of approaching other's art, understanding the language that others use to communicate that emotion. Through that lenses, most of the artistic decision making process comes from observing how emotions are communicated under a certain context, learning how to recreate those emotions through repetition, and finally allowing this vocabulary to arise naturally in a creative context.  #blogposts

Patient leadership comes from rewarding things as they arising, training people a little bit at a time. #insights #leadership

The importance of emotional regulation is learning how to both make space for your emotions and learn how to be the one to comfort yourself through them so that they're not disrupting other tasks #insight #regulation

Create a grand slam offer for Gigs, wouldn't be too difficult. Need to look at target demo and ask what it is they're looking for #business #ideas

Need to write out an obsession moment. She texted me asking to hang out tomorrow night (!!!). I responded with some stuff, but I'm desperately fearing both rejection and that I'm being overwhelming. I invited her to the gig and made myself available to reschedule for her plans. She hasn't responded since though and I'm terrified she won't respond at all now. All I can think about is that I might be detracting her by being too eager to hang out with her. Almost like I'm trying to cater to the situation. Like if she wants to hang out with me specifically then I feel like it's fine. But I scared I'm coming across as desperate in the case that she doesn't actually have any feelings for me. It's a weird conflict, sensing her jealousy and interest yet constantly scanning for signs that I might be detracting her, even when I'm supposed to be detaching anyways. Looking at every delayed text message as a punishment for being too eager, too attached, and feeling like I have to reciprocate. Or even seeing these delays as a premonition for no response at all, the worst kind of punishment. #obsession #attachmentissues

> If I show my true desire, I'll be abandoned.

What am I afraid will happen if she doesn't respond? She will abandon me. She will ridicule me and laugh at me. That I'll come to work and she'll openly mock me in front of everyone for the desperation.  She'll run away from me. I'll just be another guy in her God squad desperate for her pussy. I'll die. I'll kill myself. I'll have a panic attack. Other people will find out. She'll make a public figure out of how desperate I am. Or she'll make me feel like a dick for how poorly I treat her. She'll hurt me. She'll mock me. She'll punish me.  I'll punish myself for being too much. Too needy. Too clingy. Too over the top. I'll see myself as lesser for once again giving myself up for someone who can't even respond back in time. For someone who views me as so disposable. That I sacrificed myself once again for someone who hardly even pays attention to me.  Or hardly recognizes how I exist out of work.

A big reason I haven't dated outside of relationships (with random people) is because of my inability to properly regulate. I get so debilitated in the breakup process that I'm unable to proceed, so I've seen relationships as these catastrophic and all consuming things

# 06-07-2025

I feel guilty when I don't include her. I'm wanting to go see a movie today and I'm feeling guilty for not inviting her. With Amanda adding Greg to the group, I have fear that she'll back out now and it's putting me into a panic. It's this simultaneous urge to hurt her by not inviting her (I'm hurting because I fear her rejection), wanting her to be there, wanting to invite her just to get the credit, fear she'll reject me. It's not that I don't like Greg, it's that I know other people don't and I don't want to invite him if it means losing the people I actually want there. She doesn't even like my insta posts or watch my stories. That's where all the mixed messaging comes in. It's also like, because I know the ways I manipulate her, I project that onto her now. She's an incredibly honest/transparent person, but because there are times where I intentionally avoid messages to bring her pain, bring up topics to make her jealous, or don't invite her to create longing, I project onto her doing the same and I guess deepening our bond because of the shared pain (love) we experience. Essentially creating a trauma bond. I project onto her the same obsession. The idea that she could be sitting at home thinking about me for hours on end, trying to figure out what the next move is, how to create a deeper connection through pain, intentionally avoiding my insta stories or posts to create a deeper longing. It's entirely possible though that she doesn't have the type of awareness I have. Everything about her indicates that she has fairly pure and innocent intentions. She may be argumentative, but you know what she's feeling. It feels like the manipulation and pain game is starting to become disentangled from my perception of people.  Like it's entirely possible she's not jealous because she likes me, but instead because she just wants to be included. It's like the more I move away from this lens's of pain-induced love, the less clear it becomes whether or not she actually has any kind of feeling for me.  And now every time I have this unconscious desire to hurt her, it's accompanied by this deep guilt because I see this innocence in her now that she was somehow able to preserve throughout all that's happened and it's like I'm trying to corrupt it or take it. Like all this time she's loved me in spite of how I've treated her. She's just as playful because I've given her a container to be free. I'm just really trying to transmute this pain into something much stronger.  And it's like now, I want to express all this to her, but I can't even tell if my intentions are pure. Like I genuinely think it would fill her with a sense of joy, but I'm unsure whether this is coming from a pure place or if I'm still saying something nice to keep her from moving away from me. Like would I still want to say something if she wasn't trying to date someone? I mean, I have before. Everything I would say would be completely platonic, but I don't trust myself not to be manipulative here. I trust that what I would say would come from a place of love and vulnerability, but I don't trust myself not to try and keep her single.

Things I admire about her - preserved innocence - Transparency - Honesty

Why am I willing to give up so much of myself for her? That's a big part of the problem

I want to control you. I want to control you because that's how love was shown to me. I want to own you. I want to make you jealous. I want to tease you.  Because all of these are the ways that love was demonstrated to me. I want to post cryptic songs on instagram so you think God is sending you messages. I want to ignore your messages so you worry that I'm avoiding you. 

Despite all the pain, I did a really good job today being mindful through the suffering. It's been intense, but so many revelations are opening 

Finding love is like painting a picture. It looks so obvious in your minds eye, but actually translating it into a messy reality takes years and years of practice to make something consistently decent.  You start out being unable to paint, but piece by piece gradually begin to develop sustainable techniques.  For a relationship, the ideal is always obvious in the minds eye. But translating into reality requires a level of alchemy that most people are incapable of and are never taught how to do. #metaphors #love #progress #insights #alchemy

I'm constantly betraying myself for her which is hardly (if ever) reciprocated.

Hey dude! Was thinking about you this morning. Wanted to say how much I admired you. In spite of all the stuff you've been through, you've retained this joy, purity, and enthusiasm that I've only really experienced from a few people.  It's child-like in the most heartwarming way. It's inspiring having heard about all you've overcome and yet still have this lust for life and a deep intimacy with almost everyone you meet. And I always enjoy getting to experience it when you're around. I often look at you as a role model for how I want to treat others. How deeply I'd like to connect with them. Love you dude, hope you have a wonderful rest of the day ðŸ«¶
