There's a lot of good self soothing happening. I notice points where I would normally get jealous. They're much more muted, or quieter. Finally some fucking porgress

She's here. Trying desperately to stay centered. It's very difficult tbh. I feel my gut attacking me. My heart is racing. It's like an adrenaline surge. I can't think straight.

Career trauma could come from Catherine and Josh

A big part of my customer problem is how terrible I am at sales and marketing. Hardly anyone knows I'm teaching lessons. The customer problem is rooted in this

For the music gym idea, would probably be easiest to build something around an abandoned warehouse or abandoned storage facility. Could easily outfit something like that with a rehearsal setup #ideas #business

[Guaguanco tutorial](https://youtu.be/eWq_-tYBQLs?si=jSDSkX02esJxMpYi) #music #drums #videos Really good tutorial on the essence of guaguanco. Probably the most difficult part about this and every other Afro Cuban rhythm is pocketing myself amongst what feels like chaos, along with relying on the clave instead of 1 2 3 4. I also feel like learning about the dance is way more helpful. Like udnerstnaindg what they're looking for

Calling her cute actually does seem to increase mutual attraction. In fact most of the embodiment I've been doing has increased both my confidence and others attraction towards me#insights

This is Marketing.

What is my funnel? What is the lifetime value of a customer under my business? Right now it seems like it's nothing.

Who do I need to become to run a successful business? What does he look like?

All the material things I need to repair my current condition
- Better shoes/padding for shoes
- Cameras for practice room
- Remove all other instruments from practice room
- Repaint walls and redo floors
- More plants
- Trekking poles and water filter and backpack
- practice headphones
- More cameras
- New sticks

AI Software that automatically that can search for emotional and contextual relevance. I want something that contains ALL of my documentation, a central software, that I can ask AI to pool together all potentially relevant information (eg video segments, text segments, etc) without necessarily needing to tag the info. Should have some sentimentality analysis for emotional filtering. Ideally integrated right into an OS #ideas #apps #business #creativity

A good way to practice relative dynamics on a real kit is to only ever work with one microphone (for a while) and get good at getting the right sound purely with dynamics and control #drums #practiceideas

Blog now, newsletter later. Build infrastructure for the newsletter but leave it at that.

I have to believe in myself and my message as being something that absolutely saves lives. No bs and no manipulation. I have to get to that place before I can make genuine change

There's so much in my head today that I just have to dump it all out. Looking to go through the following
- Tackling Sales insecurities
- Building more of an authentic offer based on what I already do rather than what I want to do
- Figure out who I want to be in Her
- Finding ways to improve the lessons I'm already doing
- Resistance to meditations
- How to make onboarding easy and enthusiastic
- Fear in helping to connect others
- Ways entertainment has connected or saved my life
- Ways that indefinite coaching has impacted my life
- Undercurrent of sales being a way of directly asking someone to give me money, which Ive always had a hard time with. Trying to rephrase it
- Pride issues

Dream band:
- Me 
- Max King Cole

I feel like I need to develop either tenets of my service or grand slam offers and brainstorm ways to increase value that align what I'm willing to do. The other side is that I keep feeling like I need to constrict or define my service rigidly when I don't function well that way.

Okay so I have 3 business gardens total right now. Gigs, lessons, and sessions. My energy is devoted, almost entirely, to none of them. It's all focused on growth *in general* rather than growing any plant specifically. I still am seeking general growth on the instrument, but the more valuable I become to my current industry the easier it will be to free the time for general growth.

## Gigs 

Most of my gross revenue has come from this garden. I now charge $100/hr for this minimum unless specified otherwise.

Current clients: Spare Change, Isra, Parking Garage(?)
Previous clients: Highway 49, Patio, Tabla Rosa

###

## Lessons

Consistent revenue comes from this garden. It's much smaller because it is my youngest garden, but it is already more consistent and gratifying than the others.

Current clients: Amanda, Elaina
Previous clients: None

## Sessions

No income has been generated from this route.

Current clients: Spare Change, Jackson, Parking Garage(?)
Previous clients: None

I think the overwhelming sentiment moving forward is I'm going to have to ask for feedback from everyone I've played with to find ways to continue improving. Fuck! Actually, it might be good to open this poll to everyone on insta. Something like asking what their dream outcome is when hiring a drummer, percieved likelihood of getting that outcome, the time delay(?), and effort/sacrifice. The last two I'm not exactly sure how to measure. But it would be good to make one for people looking to hire drummers versus what a fan is looking for? Like to understand both sides of the coin for improvement. And measure these against what people I've played with are looking for. And with that it's like what more can I do to increase their security?

So this is the main thing I need to improve gigs and sessions. Lessons I feel is a different story.

Also, how do I corner the micromarket? Like the Athens market, how do I become the GOTO guy for gigs, sessions, and lessons?

I guess the ideal is that I'm an all in one package. Hiring me *pulls* a crowd too. The band profit as much as I do. It's not just hiring a drummer, it's hiring an audience. How do I become someone that pulls a crowd? How do I do so with the least effort?
- Text everyone I know in the area
- Consistently provide the best experience possible
- Sell shows better
	- What is the grand slam offer for a show? Especially one that I'm hosting?
	- How do I get over the selling insecurities?
- Daily instagram commenting (watering plants) ONLY FOR GENUINE CONNECTION NOT FOR MANIPULATION
- Referall deals ($50 to whoever refers, engineer or fellow musicians for gigs)
- Share the wealth wherever possible!!!
