Simple rules and their evolution: one of my favorite things to explore in life is *the evolution of simple rules*. In biology, we have boids, in computer science we have conway's game of life, in mathematics we have axioms. In all cases, entire fields have been evolved from the structure of simple rules. In music, I've found this same semblance in clave patterns. In reading about Afro-Cuban rhythms, its become apparent that distinctive genres are always spawned from siple rules. From the Bembe, we've evolved the Rumba, Son, and Bombo clave patterns. Each one of which has distinctive rules no what instruments to use, what rhythms to play, what dances and melodies/harmonies are spawned on top of them, which scales to use, what ceremonies celebrate.  Each of them has an entire culture that has evolved from the creation of rhythms displaced by one note (most important part). It makes me wonder, can we spawn new genres by changing the rhythm? #blogs #ideas #exerpt

If I'm noticing this much improvement by half ass rehearsals throughout the week over one or wo challenges, imagine how much improvement I would see if I did *more* within a subject. I.e. 2 hours of accents instead of one, or adding diddles, or anything like that. Improvements would be out of this world. #inspiration

One of my super powers is how critical and objective I can be. Balanced with mindfulness and my ability to synoptically connect subjects, it allows me to find patterns in places most people wouldn't. #strengths

To make coaching more valuable: - Set up same excel sheet (shared between me and client) for their accountability and my own information on guiding their practice I'm starting to understand it now. Have a base business (ie the 1-1 coaching) and everyday seek to make it more valuable. Adding value can be done by figuring out what their problems could be, and offering a solution. Over time, business will expand just by nature of encountering more problems and building more 1-many solutions at different resolutions (ie faster results for higher price, more personalized results for higher price, increased likelihood of achievement for higher price). The other side of this is the more i work with others, the easier it will become to diagnose specific issues and their solutions, which contributes back to my own practice. #business #coaching Low ball solution to accountability and other ideas: - Start off with excel/notion templates for accountable practice. Eventually work towards building an app with community feature (Strava but for music with meteronome) - Practice room renovation that increases motivation/inspiration - Transformative experience, add mirrors, change lighting, pictures of other people and inspirations

I'm worth a chocolate cake today. A $4.14 chocolate cake.  I got my first run in since rehab. I feel numb.

Simultaneously anxious that I have to see her again and having withdrawals. I'm looking for reasons to text her. I don't know how to turn this around on myself. Maybe: what is it I want/expect from her? Take my pain away. Hold me. _Carry my excitement so I don't have to feel rejected for it._ hug me. Hold me. Make the pain go away. With all the stuff I'm working through, tell me it'll be okay. Kiss me. Make the first move. Pay attention to me. Recognize that I'm struggling so that she can be there for me. Hold me. Hold me. Hold me. Be the mother I lost. Notice me when I'm in pain. Make it so I don't t have to scream to be heard.

A part of being a good leader is providing security. For people who can't provide it for themselves. How do I deepens my own

There's an intensely strong pain when I try to have the same child-like enthusiasm she has for meeting and connecting with people. It's something I love and especially love about her. It feels like it's in the gut and the chest, deriving from trauma where I was yelled at for having that enthusiasm. Once again, I see this reflected in my relationship with Mu. It's like this deep resistance to excitement out of fear that we'll be punished. It's suffocating. It makes me want to burst out into tears. #introspection

Can play more beautifully by having more control over dynamics. The better I'm able to play softer, the more elegant my playing both looks and feels. #drums

How does all of this connect back to money? I guess it's like I'm looking for ways to reclaim the childhood I never got to live, the irresponsibility that I never got to have. To get rid of the ways my dad made me feel indebted, a slave to what I wanted to have, and yet never in ownership of it. Because I would have to buy the big things I wanted, gifts were exclusive to holidays and even then I'm convinced only my mom cared, and outside of that it was my responsibility to save up for and buy everything I wanted. Even then, I never truly owned it. They would take away anything I purchased if I misbehaved, so even when I had something it was never truly mine. It's all weird, like I think I've always been sort of a minimalist. My brother was materialist while I was more experience-driven. When my parents or grandparents offered to buy us things, I never asked for anything, but meanwhile my brother always would ask for too much. I remember my brother and I would also frequently trade things and he would go back on it a day later so I had to give it back. My excitement was always squelched. Owning anything was a moot point because nothing belonged to me. I wanted to take up as little space as possible. I think it's always been that way. And even now, I don't want to own anything because it's all attachments.

So when you spend or masturbate without intention, part of that is: > "No one else is going to give me permission to feel good. So I'll take it." But it doesn't feel good after. Because what you actually want is permission to be joyfully held while you feel good--not to do it alone in hiding.

Need to stop relying on gpt as much and listen to God more

The Giantess porn feels empty and meaningless in comparison. Even masturbating to it, it doesn't turn me on the way it used to. Anything around it too. It all just feels so empty. Maybe I'm just emotionally exhausted

Being around her friend brings out jealousy and defensiveness. A simultaneous urge to spit on him for trying to get close to her like that, a pity for him even trying, and a defensive feeling of I shouldn't connect to him because he's only here for her. But in looking at my habits, it makes sense why she gets so much closer to people than I do. She spends time genuinely talking to them. I push them away as fast as I can. I'm afraid of the connection, so I avoid it. Life will be so much better if I spend that time and effort talking to them.

A major part of the rush I'm in is because I want this pain to be over. I want money problems to go away and I feel like the quicker I can move past this issue, the faster I can move on with my life. I think the paradox with this is that money has always kind of had this issue where it's always a rush. It's always something that I have to move faster to get through and I haven't found a way to do it presently yet when I think about everything with money, it feels like the council of elders my dad and both my grandparents have always stressed the importance of money, but in a way that makes it feel Like an obligation rather than an opportunity and that my career should solely align with whatever is going to give me the most income I think a lot of their mindsets have failed to acknowledge how separate streams of income is much more stable than a single source especially something that is so volatile And I think if you combine this with everything that's happened in my life where money has always been kind of an antithesis to the things I actually desire you know like attention a wall or a pain then it makes sense that I've always had this large to disdain for money. And I think with the other issues it wasn't as much. I was trying to get over something as I was trying to understand something but here it feels like I'm trying to get over something so I can move on with my life and the problem with this is that it is eating up so much of my time trying to separate my Business and into very different things you know trying to start a newsletter trying to do a YouTube channel trying to build like a boot camp when I don't even have like the basic business up and running like I feel like I'm trying to overcomplicated and the combination of all those things with my jobs at Starbucks is eating away all of my time Just making it difficult to even practice, which is the main reason I'm doing this to begin with and so it's just endlessly frustrating trying to figure out how to manage everything all at once when I don't even have the basic thing up and running and I guess that's why I'm getting frustrated as I feel like I'm just getting caught up and planning everything instead of actually doing something to change my life situation I think part of that comes from not acknowledging my own worth like I think ideally, I wanna charge $100 an hour and I'm trying to mentally justify that. All this planning is being done so that I can feel worth more for what I'm offering.

All this money stuff has awoken me into a panic at 3 AM. It's brought out a level of stress, anxiety, and panic that I haven't experienced since I left grad school. And I can't seem to shake it. All the meanwhile, there's been memories of my time at Cisco intermixed with premonition about AI takeover. I wonder if the DUI incident has anything to do with it all. But anyways, I have a feeling overcoming my finance issues means touching on that level of stress that exists inside me still from that era of my life. Fuck!

Who is my SVM?  - no clue - Drummers looking to improve?  - Drummers struggling to make that next step in their career?  - I have no clue There's so much pain and doubt in my head that I feel like a failure. I don't even have people in my life I'm trying to help. Like maybe Drew, Ethan, Nick, Stephen, and other Athens drummers? I guess it makes sense to picture them from now on when I'm explaining things. Especially for reels. That's grounding the market. But it brings up this other contradiction in my head on whether to compare within or without. I felt like I was inspired until I read this fucking marketing book that shut down a lot of my ideas. Tbf it didn't shut them down so much as it just adjusted them to reality, giving a proper audience to cater to. I just still don't know how to reconcile building solutions for someone else while marketing in a way that remains true to myself. Like how do I build a blog and reels and YouTube that explore my curiosity in a way that still markets to the people I want to attract? That's my big dilemma here. I don't know how to be authentic and marketable at the same time. 1 for them 1 for me? I mean, I think I actually enjoy making resources for them *when I know what they're looking for*. Like with TikTok, it gives me the queries so I know how to better help. But it feels too Ambiguous trying to guess for myself and I get frustrated with that. Like it's the middle ground of exploring with curiosity and knowing how to relate that into what people want. SVM makes sense though because if you spread it to people you know already that need that information, that's real world evidence.

"Learn to torture us in delightful ways" - EK I REALLY like this quote. It begs the reader to acknowledge the ways in which we like to torture people and asks us to do it better. I think it's made me realize I like that sexual tension and musical tension 

Also need to work through standing at the precipice of both creative freedom and social freedom. also patterns in attraction. Like what is recurrent and why I feel like the recurrence of Jess into my life is playing a part in it

Notes on new TikTok (Bembe lesson) - No sheet music, it would really be nice to have it - I like how explicit it is and how it begins - saying there's 4 parts at the beginning could've added more tension - Can tell there's a lot more confidence and excitement behind it - Is generic lesson okay? I've shat on them for so long but maybe they're actually helpful - Wished I did multicam - Overall, I liked this one much more than previous ones. Less click bait I think

I think the solution is to be more intentful. Not just making whatever video I want in the moment, but try and get a better idea of where the story I want to tell matches the story someone else needs to hear

Starting to understand that Afro Cuban, as a genre, uses very little drum set. In almost all scenarios, drum set is a recreation of the original sound. So learning how to play it is equal parts theory and creativity in recreation

What do i expect/want for $100?  - Transformative experience, guard rails that set me on a new trajectory. Actually transformative might be worth more. Like with PT at $100, it's all self accountability. How much more would having someone ensuring you're making progress be worth? Like micromanaged accountability and structure - Accountability - Visible progress - Guaranteed end result. If I go to a marathon coach, I want a guaranteed timeline for a marathon, or at the very least some form of verifiable results

My dream isn't to be the performer. It's to be the drummer other drummers come to for guidance. To be so skilled that other people want to learn from me

I want to cry right now. I'm so overwhelmed. Partially because I've been driving myself since 7 AM without a break, without really any food, and running on 6 hours of sleep. With all that said, it makes sense. But now Jaida is bringing up skydiving and I can't afford it and it's bringing up trauma around people that bail on me. Also anxious about the reel. #emotions

For the next video, could be interesting to reframe the video as I explain different parts of the Bembe. Like instead of all from the one angle, look up from the kick during the kick pattern, from the hh perspective during hh, etc. I like that idea.

It's cool that a small meditation session now is ~30min. #progress

I still feel emotionally numb this morning. But I'm worth this $25.86 coffee.

Even in trying to work out rooms with my family, I give myself the shitty, small end of the stick under the guise of enjoying camping and for sacrifice for the family. I may enjoy camping but I'm trying to be malleable for value. But the problem is I don't know how to discern between self-worth and flexibility. How does one discern between egotism and confidence here? Like is the very act of trying to take the smallest room, the smallest space, or not even to be in the house with the family in any way an act of selfless sacrifice or is it self-neglect in support of the family? For that matter, I love the philosophy of minimalism, but it feels like the supporting beliefs I have for minimalism aren't rooted in spiritual or mindful beliefs so much as they are backed by my desire to disappear and shrink.

I've begun noticing this in other aspects to. Like in music, I've done my best over the past two years to step away from the limelight. Not in the sense of trying to shrink myself, but more in an effort to become more of a team player. I think in doing so I've tried my best to become more focused on groove and allow the stage to be dominated by the other musicians. Like becoming a stable platform for them to perform on. But as I get more into this, I feel like I'm starting to see that even this mindset is riddled with the same shrinking mentality. I think with all of it, I'm struggling to see balance between creating stability and taking the center-stage when I need to take it.

I feel this immense inner-security and strength rising within me now. Like I'm arising into something completely new. A version of myself who doesn't shrink for other people. Who is confident in his decisions and his abilities. Who is a Brat. Who is owned by Her. Who values himself. Someone who paves the road for others to walk on. It makes me feel like all I really need to do for this business venture is put out into the world that I'm teaching lessons for $100/hr with only 5 students at a time and spend the rest of the time making it worth more, increasing prices over time. Improving it the same way I improve drumming. Let the bootcamp come after the rest has taken off. Value myself higher, because I'm really fucking good now. I'll keep getting better, but I'm great. Ngl some part of me is worried I won't keep progressing, even though it's all I want to do. There's still so much to fucking learn and I'm excited, but I've neglected it all a bit and it makes me anxious. Going into why would probably be good. I think I've mainly just neglected the documentation aspect of it, because I know I've progressed a lot recently. I just haven't been keeping track of it the way I did the first quarter. Really need to record more.

I don't know what I'm interested in anymore though, because the more I get away from shrinkage the less it makes me feel anything.

Ya know? I don't actually want to go camping. Liol. I want to want it, but I'm looking for a reason to make them bail. I'm looking to make it into a bad time. In fact, I fucking hate camping. Or at the very least, I'm terrified of it. I love the idea of it. The utility of it. Being completely with nature. But actually doing it sounds awful

She's talking to someone and I'm getting possessive. I want to own her. And fight him. Shoo him away and tell him how despicable he is. I'm jealous of the attention he gives her. Even when she's obviously the one initiating it. The #progress I see now is that there's obviously no harmful or devious intentions. She is just genuinely being nice and talking to them. I don't even see them as being inherently flirting anymore. It's just two people talking about life the same way I do with Jeff or Brian. But the part I'm having a hard time with is figuring out how to recenter on myself

I feel like the career I'm trying to create is like a growth specialist or life coach of some sorts

I made conversation with a stranger!! #progress she was holding flowers and I just complimented them. It opened up a really simple conversation that I went into with all sorts of curiosity. Even just engaging in conversation opened up ways to improve. Like recognizing that there can be space in it without it being awkward, asking more value driven questions, etc. I was also much more of a brat at work, to the point that Brandi said I was like a 9 year old

The video I (kind of) half ass made yesterday actually did really well. 367 views in 12 hours, 20+ likes and a comment. Validation!! I actually liked it too. Goes to show that resisting teaching is bad. I'm decent at it, and I'll make it better. Good start to the funnel! The inner validation has made it a lot easier to post this stuff 

I'm really anxious to see her. I think it's an excessive excitement, the more I think about it the more it is that. I'm terrified of it. Especially terrified she's leaving. My stomach legit hurts I'm so excited. How do I allow it while recentering on myself

I enjoy my TikTok's better when I state things from my perspective and experience, rather than saying you should do this state this is what improved things for me

Anxious about how little practice I keep getting. Like today there was 20 minutes of misused time. 10 was talking to my brother, but still. I'm just frustrated because I know I need to go deeper with Afro Cuban stuff but I just keep hitting this fucking wall. I think I also just got really frustrated trying to record this video, not knowing what to say at all. 

The [[Seth Godin]] marketing book [[This is Marketing]] really does a good job of emphasizing the focus of everything. It resonates a lot with all I've already learned. I could see it working a lot better by understanding more of what the people I know are loookimg for 

I think it's more just the precedent of having only practiced 28 hours this month that freaks me out and makes me anxious, when the intention has been to get at a minimum twice as much. Or even deeper, it's a frustration and discomfort with how little I understand how to feel and play Afro Cuban drums (akin to when I first got into jazz), not having prepared anything for Amanda, being exhausted, being emotionally overworked, being insecure about my content creation and making it into a performance, being overwhelmed with how much I already have to create and what little time I have to do it, and not having exercised.

What are the stories I need for - Ethan Houseman - Drew Serrero - Gideon Johnston - Nick - Andrew Yi - Steven Ledbetter - Jesse Mangum - Elijah Johnston - Trautwein - David Clark - Jack 

Reading this book, it makes sense why reels never worked in the past. They weren't to help anyone. It was just trying to "show off"

I like my TikTok's better when they are quick witted, which is difficult because I'm not quick witted and that competes with the mindfulness I want to promote and attract. Where's the middle ground?

Best way to approach drug boundary with SC is to invite them. Ask if we can put some boundary on the writing process instead of commanding it

I'm starting to see a lot of things grow. After yesterday, I had a long talk with my mom about like the progress I was making and something she pointed out is that it's really cool to see how much things have like progressed and changed since I started this process and it made me realize that like a lot of what's happened over the past year has been a combination of rooting And dying in a sense but also trial and error like at the core of it. You know like with the whole education thing, it was a seed that I planted over a year ago I think maybe even more than that but it's only beginning to sprout or bear some kind of fruit And I think a lot of it was that I planted the seed with no idea how to grow it and it was just over and over trying different little things to influence me to do it or like dehorning myself enough to make it an option and it feels like you know I would try it and I would mess up or it wouldn't work out in a lot of that came in form of like you know doing it on TikTok Putting out the idea that I wanted to teach, but never really committing to it but now with Amanda and with like oh fuck there was a dead squirrel anyway I just scared the shit out of me but yeah, now it's it's getting easier in a sense that I don't really feel so afraid of posting Educational content. I don't really feel afraid of making blogs. You know it feels like I've built a really solid framework of creativity you know, having all these dumps that I do makes it easy to see myself as a work in progress to acknowledge my vulnerabilities and it's obviously something I'm still improving on, but from where I was like a year ago, it's greatly improved I think a lot of it really comes from the books. I read you know that they've all kind of given some little piece of the puzzle you know cause I think now about how existential kink has kind of opened up the same kind of therapy I was dealing with a year or two ago. You know something I've been kind of chasing it for a long time away to get deeper with all these sorts of emotions and like I love doing it like I love the work. I just takes a lot out of you and it changes a lot very instantly, but it's that combined with or it's the confidence and the power that that kind of thing has given me combined with you know that the stuff from still like an artist combine with the artist way combined of the war of art you know all these books kind of give a little piece of the puzzle that really like shifts your mind it's kinda like I wish I didn't have to go to all these places to get it but something about having different perspective changes everything

Now I would much rather own her than the other way around

To get to that next level of drumming requires full immersion. How can I get fully immersed in the genres I'm trying to learn? Like in acting, having people actually go through boot camp for a war movie...that's the decdication that makes real results. For jazz, it means joining jazz jams. For Afro Cuban, it means studying with the tribes or Cubans who can shed different, unique insights.

I was super anxious yesterday and my whole body was stiff/tense. I wonder how much those two are related. I also was in such a rush until right before bed where I finally took a moment to be real and feel all the pain I'd been bulldozing through. I need to spend less time "working" on mental health and more just feeling it presently. Probably another EK/Shadow work thing to do.

What is the intention of today's lesson? Recording basics: melody lines, tempo, Goals for today with Amanda - Review Fmaj and Amin chords, blues progression - Teach garage band as a tool for learning - Teach music theory as a way to learn intervals - Teach the metronome - Knowing when you're on beat - Different parts - Improvise on top of blues

Work brought out a lot of misery today. It was a rush for 4 hours straight, no break. I think the worst part was that the vibes were overall very low. I kept trying to bring them up, but it ended up being a lot of wasted energy. By the time work was over, I was too crashed out to properly thank everyone from a place of vulnerability. I just had to leave. And it's like I wish I could've been more available for it. Brandi was the most difficult part. All the connection issues are difficult right now because whenever I'm around her, there's such a massive part of my focus that gravitates towards her. Like I think the issues I had with her today were genuine, but I think the recurring pattern of finding problems with her is just a way to focus on her more or stay attached and create more drama for myself. The specific issues were that I feel like her gratitude is few and far between. I don't feel appreciated for the work I do with her and don't feel like I'm getting the support I need. The other side is that I don't want to give the same support back because I'm not getting it from her. And it's like I know that in order to get what I want, I have to be the role model here. I have to properly thank and appreciate her for what she does. I do it for everyone else, why is it so hard with her?

This girl I've attached to is someone I frequently have problems with. I've gained enough awareness to recognize when she's around, my focus is magnetized to her. I don't even feel like I have the control to detach from it, and it's like I'm constantly looking for issues that somehow keep me attached and thinking about her. What ya the EK here?

Do I still want to lead through service when I'm not being seen? And if so, can I do that without erasing myself in the process?

It makes me angry and defensive. Because it's like how can you possibly treat someone you love like this? Like you're in fucking school to become a leader, the principles of leadership are not to manage but to lead. To have authority by being in the first rank. To boost morale. How can you claim to love someone and do nothing to support them? Or not nothing, but how can you watch someone you love fighting for their fucking life and just stand there asking them for more? How fucking delusional are you to think that's appropriate? How can you not even acknowledge how much they're doing to try and support you? Are your lenses so self-centered that you can't possibly fathom the concept that someone else is at their fucking limits? When will it ever be enough for you? Is this how all of your relationships were? If so, it's no wonder they were all failures. It's no wonder everyone leaves you. You're too much of a "victim" to recognize the fact that you cause all of your problems. I hear you give yourself all the credit for everything you put together without ever sharing the wealth with the people who made it happen. You played such a small role yet take all of it. And I've never seen you do that for me, so it's hard to believe you're capable of it to begin with. If you actually wanted to hang out with me then maybe you'd put in the effort to set something up for once without always leaving it to me. _And honestly, I'm so fucking turned on by this dynamic_. Just saying that has completely lightened the load, it makes so much sense now too

Now I'm just stressed because I don't at all understand Afro Cuban music. I need some kind of system for feeling it fully throughout my body and analyzing it to understand the traditions better. Understanding it is going to require doing the dirty work of transcribing and recognizing the significance of each part. That's how I deepen this. Would also be worth learning Afro Cuban solos by congueras, timbeleras to imitate on set. This one in particular would be fun https://youtu.be/tNrGZelOvC0?si=mI4ZuAzzJSKyHVCN #drumsolos

I'm also addicted to my phone rn and really need to get away from it because it's driving me fucking crazy. I feel like something is genuinely wrong and I can't get away long enough to figure it out

What is the ESSENCE of Afro Cuban rhythms? The problem is also not even knowing where to look

# 05-24-2025

What im starting to understand after watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Coy3uS7RCo  is that Afro-Cuban is primarly taking a clave pattern and combining it with some other orientation of the other limbs that resembles the other instruments. I need to figure out how to explain this in simple terms because it's not described at all in this book. I'm also starting to understand how different the pulse is. I'm so used to 4/4 that I can feel it no matter where I go. The clave patterns are so different that I don't know where we are half the time.

But simpler terms is like...okay now I get what the book is trying to do. I think I'm just not reading it well. The book is basically saying here are all the original parts, combine them to get this thing. I feel like I should be more patient with the whole thing. I'm not exploring it with enough curiosity.

But the most insane part I'm realizing is just how different all these things are from 4/4. Like it's not like they're actually in 4/4 at all, there are times where no part of that pulse ever exists. Things just shift from 3-2 to 2-3, almost like it exists in a time separation of its own. Feeling it in 4/4 seems just wrong in that perspective. How do native players of these genres count, if at all?

I want David on my team no matter what

I now realize how important learning about cultural history is to analyzing/learning music fast. The ending to Lingus is just a rumba

What I didn't like about this TikTok - Couldn't properly articulate half of what I was trying to say (although most of it still came out alright) - Playing isn't always necessary, sometimes just describing is enough - Need to be more diligent in citing sources - Still don't know how to approach it all from a standpoint of mindfulness and awareness

Things I noticed at work today: - Jealousy when I heard about Andy texting someone else about a hike - Fear that by being more tenacious in getting a date/activity set with Andy, that I was being too much - Pushing the envelope too much and pushing him away - Mindful and more intentional in my approach to working, less movement but more deliberate - More openly loving with David and Andy, and more generous with physical touch - Longer eye contact

Walking slowly but intentionally, always, is a key to mindfulness. Noticed this at work today, didn't have the energy to push myself but somehow being in less of a rush made it easier to act more intentionally fully.

Would be really cool to do a Wes Anderson style of TikTok's, or at least the speech patterns. Quick, but intentional

Overall, want the vibe of my teaching style to focus on awareness and focus the way that my practices have. How can I communicate that more effectively? How can I also Imrpove my teaching with Amanda to reflect this? Also, what all went wrong with Amanda yesterday? Dopamine detox day so maybe I'll work on this later, unsure

# 05-25-2025

Having a really hard time being decisive about the next decision for my business. I know I need to make a website, but have no idea what I'm doing as far as marketing goes. Or really what the fuck I'm trying to do. Like I think what I want more than anything is to be a drum coach, to solve other drummers problems and guide them. To get them to come to me with their problems and then create or find solutions for them so they can continue growing on their own. Having a hard time with the fears here, because I feel like an important step of this is to separate myself in some ways as an authority on drums. I'm trying way too hard to do it without actually talking to anyone.

The most confusing part of afro cuban #drumming has been that its a replication of multiple instruments, not just the instrument on its own. Its the only real form of drumming where drum set didn't start out as the main instrument. Going into learning it, I had the impression that I was picking up a guide on drumset performance, but what I've learned from this book is that none of AFro-Cuban music was ever written or intended for drum set. The different timing feels conflict with 4/4 all the time, because they weren't written in 4/4. They were alwasy meant to groove as a standalone. I think it was just frustrating going into the topic thinking i was learning how to play like bossa nova and salsa and instead got an introduction to how drums aren't welcomed here from the beginning. I'm still struggling to understand all the cultural significances and all the other parts being played on top of the clave.
