- "The part of me that wants to be a brat is really craving…"

Emotional security. Freedom to express myself fully and openly in front of
everyone without judgement. To punish delightfully. To hurt other people as a
symptom of the depth of my emotional suppression. To make others feel the pain
I've been suffering in silently for so long. A tantrum. A breakdown. A massive
explosion where I finally let the world around me see the truth I've been
sitting with. To be transparent. To let other people see how much I've hidden
from them for so long. The excitement. The pain. The anger. The frustration.
The longing. The loneliness. The desire. Most importantly the desire. The sex.
The freedom. Someone to control me and tell me what to do. Someone to fucking
listen. Someone that will let me feel every way I need to feel and will love me
regardless. Someone that sees me explode and doesn't seek to calm it down.
Someone who adds fuel to the fire, knowing that it can't be tamed but it can be
sped up. Someone who meets me where I am, sees me fully, allows me to be fully
honest and communicative and doesn't take it the wrong way when I say something
I don't mean.

- "If I were fully a brat, I would finally feel…" Free to express myself.
  Freedom of the burden of responsibility. Allowed to have a tantrum. Allowed
to be seen in my pain. Feee to breakdown. Not having to hide the fact that I'm
in pain. Not suffering in silence. Not taming my excitement.

- "The fear I'm avoiding by wanting to be A brat is…"

- "What I wish someone would say to me is…"

Do whatever you need to do. Say what ever you need to see. I'll still be here
after. You're mine, and I'll take care of you no matter what. I'll always be
here for you. Even in your meltdowns, I'm all your and you're all mine. I want
to see how excited you can get. I want to see how devastated you can be. Show
me your worst, and I'll love it all the same. I want to see the real you. Not
the version you show the rest of the world, but the version that you hide. I
want to see how bad you can be. How messy you can be. How disastrous you can
be. **The more you thrash, the better it feels for me.** When you're here, it's
safe to be the real you. The one who disdains their coworkers. The one who
makes fun of your clients. The one that makes fun of your brothers and parents
and friends. The one who does all those things yet is excited to see all of
them. The one who loves drums and music and hasn't been able to share that
depth of love for it with anyone. The one who has never felt like their love
has been matched. Like their excitement has been felt. I see you. I want you
inside me.

To embody the feeling of being a brat--in its sovereign, not destructive,
form--is to reclaim the part of you that was once punished, ignored, or feared
for being too much. It's not about immaturity or entitlement. It's about
emotional liberation with a backbone.

  

Here's how I'd break it down into somatic, behavioral, and energetic elements
so you can live it:

* * *

### 1. Posture + Body Language:
- Walk like you already own the room, but don't need the room to notice.
- Keep your chest open, jaw relaxed, hips loose--like you're dancing with
  gravity.
- Move in deliberate rebellion--shoulders swaying slightly when you walk, eyes
  lingering, lips curling in mischief when you're curious.

  

The brat doesn't rush. They make you wait. They make you want.

* * *

### 2. Speech + Expression:
- Speak with play in your voice. Elongate your vowels when you want to savor
  something.
- Use silence like a smirk. Pause before you answer--let people lean in.
- Be a little indulgent. Say things like:

"Mmm… I don't feel like doing that."

"Convince me."

"That sounds boring. Let's do something better."

  

Not because you're defiant. But because you give yourself permission to feel
what you feel, say what you want, and flirt with discomfort.

* * *

### 3. Emotionally:

- Let your joy be excessive. Let your desire be obvious. Let your sadness be
  seen.
- Don't modulate your energy for others' comfort.
- If you're excited about something, get giddy. If you're annoyed, pout. If
  you're turned on by life, show it.

  

*The brat doesn't repress--they express with flair and unapology.

* * *

### 4. Spiritually:

- The sacred brat believes that divine joy is a birthright.

That rebellion is holy when it's authentic.

That play is a form of prayer.

  

This part of you doesn't destroy for destruction's sake.

They crack open old structures to let life flood back in.

They are the spirit of unsanctioned freedom.

* * *

### Brat Mantras (Choose or make your own):

- "My emotions are art, not threats."
- "I'm allowed to want more without earning it."
- "Chaos is my color palette."
- "If you can't meet me in the fire, don't ask to feel my heat."
* * *

Techniques for the minimalist drummer #ideas #books

One thing I "resent" about brats is their playfulness. There's something so
attractive about how playful they are and excitable they are that I see it as
inherently flirtatious and manipulative. But what if I've just misunderstood it
this whole time? What if they were always telling the truth, that they were
just being nice? Like what if it's actually okay to be playful and flirtatious
with everyone without expectations? Is it possible to just be that way because
it feels good? And if so, how? How can I embody that playfulness, excitement,
and magnetism in a way that gives me that feeling of love, confidence, power,
and overall just joy? How--when it's hurt me so much in the past--can I embody
this in a way that isn't abused or irresponsible? Like how can I experience
that attraction I felt with Jess, Lizzie, and Brandi, with *everyone*? Because
if I'm honest when I look at it, I've always been so jealous of their ability
to attract people like that. Is it inconsistent to flirt with people that I
have no interest in, or responsible? Like are there times and people where it's
inappropriate? Or should I be that magnetic with everyone? This is where I'm
confused because it feels weird to default feeling flirty and excitable and
horny around someone younger. Like am I allowed to feel those things without
their participation? Is it harmful to resist it? I guess the truth is yes it's
harmful to resist, I just don't need to act on it. Maybe it's intention? Like
allowing myself to feel that way without any intent to act on it? Accepting
that it's there and how much it's there seems like a starting point. But how do
I grow it into the magnetism that Brandi has?

The way she kissed her child with such tenderness, love, and excitement made
me feel love and pleasure. I want that so bad. In relationship form.

The incredible #progress is that now every time I record myself playing, a
lot of what I play actually comes out sounding pretty good and as intended. I'm
definitely still trying to lean more into feeling and groove and finding ways
to recreate emotion with it, but it makes me really happy to see how far I've
come and to hear just like fluid playing. I definitely need to understand more
#mindfulness in both playing and everyday conversations, fixating more on
slowing down, being intent full, assertive, and present. Still, I'm still proud
of the direction. One thing that's really going to make it easier to write my
own music is to just record demos everyday. Like the one I did today about
Brat...it actually feels pretty bratty. I love it.

Like allowing myself to feel that way without any intent to act on it? Accepting that it's there and how much it's there seems like a starting point. But how do I grow it into the magnetism that Brandi has?

It's like I feel like I can notice it differently now like I think about everything with Jess like running through my mind whenever she would go to these football conferences and have these like men flirt with her or when she would go out to bars and the same thing would happen and she would always come back and talk about like all the people that wanted to be with her and I mean, I remember feeling insecure about it like I think, even the fact that they had to brag about it you know her, and Brandy and whoever else it just felt inconsiderate, and it felt like an abusive of their power and like I don't wanna turn into that you know like I want to allow myself to feel attracted and attractive with new people and like I feel like I felt it today like I held eye contacts for longer I know there were a couple people where I just talked to them for longer or when I was attracted to them I just talked to them. It's like I trusted myself to have a good conversation with them. You know I guess like I'm confused where the line is on you know acting on it like acting on it also count with like just talking to them I don't know cause if it's someone younger than it just feels weird. It's not really something I want, but I feel like I have to accept it the same with like if it's family I feel like the problem isn't that it's there. It's just that for so long I've judged it for being there which is just exacerbated the whole thing. It's like I have a hard time envisioning what it looks like moving forward you know how to be playful and flirty with everyone you know not wearing a mask anymore just being myself you know, and I think those parts are part of me just being a bit of a brat then I'm trying to understand how to do it all in a really positive way you know to lake it feels like for so long. The excitement has been suppressed and the energy and the happiness. It's like I've been trying to mirror everyone else's energy, which I think works to connect, but it's not true to myself you know I found myself saying hi to everyone on my walk today which was a huge shift and energy and it's like I just wanna be that person that is excited about whatever you know like I wanna be able to properly communicate how much I love drumming I think it's just I've grown up in a family. That's kind of been dismissive of it when I think about it you know it's like there's all these things. I'm excited about But we just have a bunch of people who spot problems like Nana I guess my dad, my mom really it's just they're all war rewards making mountains out of molehills. It's like I don't know how to envision this version that I wanna be you know cause I can look at them and see that maybe they never intended to hurt anyone you know I think it's like the part I get confused about is like where they always just being themselves or is there some secret part of them that needs attention and is that such a bad thing like I'm afraid to step into this role because I don't wanna be someone that leads people on or makes people uncomfortable like I want it to be a magnetic thing and I feel like to next step I have to accept that another one's gonna like it, but I feel more more drawn into it the more I do it it's just the power of the sensation of it is like it's nice you know having grown up without, and he say having to constantly mirror people's emotions and be calm and stuff like that it's like feeling owned by something bigger than myself and also having the freedom to be as expressive and chaotic and playful or flirtatious so I want to be and still feeling like there's something out there taking care of me. It's free and it makes me wanna keep working at it, but it's like I'm overwhelmed with how much I need to do. It's like these kinds of things are making it clear you know the kinds of habits I need to succeed and prosper in like this next stage of my life and a lot of them revolve around like being public being confident, you know, reaching out and creating things for people and showing the world who I am and it's it's scary you know like it's really hard like today I should go for a long time trying to figure out if I should make you know, Block posts and weekly content or not weekly but newsletters and you know starting to pick those things up to create a funnel for my own career and I just became like daunted by how much I already didn't accomplish today but decided to do those things instead because they felt more important. I don't know where I'm going with that. It's like today instead of practicing instead of meditating you know, instead of resting I spent the day putting out information into the world like I spent the day making a TikTok and making a blog post and making a blog. I guess if I look at it, those are all signs of like confidence and especially that I was able to get so many things done in one day and like I don't know it feels like there's this whole backlog of things that have wanted to do that not having the confidence has kept me from and it's like now I even starting to feel it and it's like I'm just overwhelmed trying to. I guess catch up especially when it feels like the more important thing is still just to go Practice and learn more things or even just to do this kind of like mental health work it's like it's hard to focus right now because there are so many path forward and I don't know what's the right thing to do. It's like I feel like the changes that are coming from doing this kind of like EK works are transformative and it's like I wanna keep doing them either that or I want to really build this business and it's like I'm excited to do it. It's like even now I feel the releases in my nervous system and covering all this stuff. I've kind of digress but it's like I wanna embody the brat and I wanna be owned and I feel like those things are becoming more true and I'm just hoping I'm ready for them

This fucking video is hanging over my head. The sooner I can get it done, the
less stress I'll be under. And I can actually move on to the next fucking video
without feeling like I have this tech debt

Why in the most intimate masturbation moments do I feel pain? Why is there guilt or fear there? Why when it's supposed to feel the best does it feel the worst?

New Starbucks District Manager briefly toured with Dance Gavin Dance

Why would it hurt to look at her story? To see her enjoying life without me? I guess I'm afraid to see something that disproves the idea that she loves me. Giving someone else attention mainly. I don't like to share. It reminds me a lot of when u started seeing Jess with Ichi. The pain and isolation was maddening.

I've been much more flirty and playful today. I'm not afraid of eye contact anymore. Still, there's a nervous system anxiety pervading.

It really feels like an attention thing. I'm addicted to it. The only reason cheating sucks or the thought of her being with someone else sucks is because she's not paying attention to me. She may not even be thinking about me. It's like I want to have a temper tantrum about it. I want her eyes on me, all the time. Holding me. Touching me. Being with me. Talking with me. Flirting with me. Always giving me that attention. I need ALOT of attention, but not too much or I'll get annoyed. I only want it when it's not here and I'm suffering withdrawals.

I feel this part of me looking back on my mom. Going from having all that attention to suddenly none of it, or very little. I still feel the effects of it.

I'm doing better at allowing myself to be attracted to who and whatever I need to be. In doing so, there's less of a pressure on forcing myself to like someone I "should" like.

What is the focus today?

Creating a flirty, playful environment. Embodying magnetism. Understanding on a much deeper level why I've resented them for being so effortlessly attractive. Detaching from Brandi and continuing to be aware of when I'm drawn to her for *comfort* or *safety* as a consequence of attachment. Rewarding myself when I notice that I wanted to but didn't *touch* her (virtually).

Intention for today's dump: 20 min dump MAINLY focused on the 6 week program. Also may include some stuff on the afro-cuban rhythms and other general knowledge dumping

Okay so mainly wanted to get a dump out on the six week program honestly have
no idea so far and also wondering if anyone is doing anything like this and how
i market it to them i feel like i have a better grasp on what people are
looking for like honestly it seems sort of simple if all theyre really looking
for is an outlet and something to do or a skill they wanted to learn that now
they finally have time for but what can be accomplished in six weeks honestly
hat is even really important in six weeks i guess to start being able to larn
from a song how to sit at the instrument how to improve yourself how to get
faster how to build up speed how to play more musically how to build the hait
idk should it be twelve weeks maybe not twelve but it feels like 8 or 9 is
better like i want to make it so that the practice goes on for the duration of
habit generation so that idk i dont want it too long like i want the dealine so
its unambiguous but what are their goals like what are they trying to
accomplish part of the problem is i have no idea what theyre looking for what
theyre looking to accomplish and combine that with what i know it still feels
like what i really need right here is evidence or sources  people to talk to
about this kind of thing so i can understand better what im looking for like it
may be worthwhile to do some actual market research like to reach out to like
over a 100 people and just ask if they or anyone they know is looking to learn
drums at any point and really see what it is they're looking for or maybe make
an ad im not sure like i feel like on one side i should get started buton the
other fuck it research at this point just feels like its a form of
procrastiation im not going to be able to improve it until i start it amybe it
all works from the get go but also its not going to work right away at least im
going in with that mindset so im not dissapointed if it doesnt i dont
understand what im going here and i want to make another quick tiktok on
improving dynamics so i need to look up a place where they offer these sorts of
exercises for free so that other people can really get better at this sort of
thing i also want to write so many more blog articles now that the hatch is
open like all the ones i want to write on mindfulness are starting to pop up in
my head and i drew this line around my wrist that i really want tattooed
anyways i feel so much less judgemental and more powerful ever since starting
to open my sefl to the brat/owner identities its actually bee a huge change to
my self esteem okay what are the six weeks why i dont give it over to chatgpt
just evades me it would be so easy to let chatgpt figure it out and just make
me do the actual work like solving all their problems would be so easy i figure
that like my niche going forward is just going to be drummers its going to
start with people interested in getting started and probably move on from there
to something else okay what do we actually need i guess a lesson on holding the
sticks sitting at the kit and getting the first beat out probably a lesson on
how to feel the music every week should have some type of homework associated
with it like im thinking $500 for 6 weeks with a 2 week guarantee if things
don't go smoothly or they don't get their money's worth and i still have to
figure out all the bonuses like some are probably going to be around sound
proofing or getting a kit to set up with i wish i could do it virutally but i
really think the best idea is to do in person for now start at 5 people then go
up to 10 next month i wish i could get people to buy into 3 month lesson plans
rather than weekly lessons so that its not just idk me being fucking dumb or
some shit no its more because its a 3 month training cycle of improvement i
feel like its important to also take videos to demonstrate how they improve or
to encourage a meditation and a journaling session to track improvements and
also recognize imrpovements constantly which is already what i kind of do idk
okay so we have a lesson on like etiqute around the kit we need a lesson in
there about feeling but i feel like these 6 lessons need to be so nutrient rich
that they feel worth so much more than what they are paying like every lesson
they should leave feeling like holy shit my mind is numb that was so much
information like every single lesson needs to feel like a fucking trip to the
heaviest gym and they need to leave each session feeling like new people
completely evolved from who they once were and its insane so the first week is
that basic lesson the second week starts out with a review then it goes into a
lesson on feeling music, emotion in music, specifically pointing out tracks
which discern between different emotions because the point of the class isnt to
make shredders its to make groovers people that other musicians actually want
to play with we're crafting a mindset here that awakens people the point of
this class is a hidden method for awakening people its not just about learning
drums its about learning how to express yourself in a way that you never
thought possible its a way about relieving suppression i want to masturbate so
badly right now like after all this intimacy i explored today im so fucking
horny ookay anyway yeah week two about feeling groove which is also about
listening to music and trying to recreate what we feel should singing be done
here or is that for later i think here probably i dont even know if sight
reading should be part of the curriculum especially with how little i use it
maybe it should be idk i feel like its important in reference to the meteronome
like if we theme each week each one should cover a different aspect of
performance like week 1 is technique week 2 is groove week 3 is time week 4
dynamics week 5 sound and week 6 musicality actually that's kind of genius i
felt like this idea came to me before but idk i feel like thats the way to go
about it so that at least is the most fruitful of the ideas it would be good to
brainstorm and explore each one individually so we can really understand the
different mechanics of each week then after that use them to delve much deeper
like if the purpose of the whole camp is to delve into the different sextents
of drumming theres also the possibility of extending it two weeks with week 1
being the overview and week 8 being the closing but honestly the faster it can
end the better not just for them but for me too and i think citing Benny Greb
as a major inspiration here is important but i think using this framework to
help people get started is massive plus there's a much wider audience among
beginngers like i want to lead the next wave of drummers by being a starter i
want to lower the barrier of entry not just cost wise but finding solutions
that help people drum from a much younger age and much more frequently like the
fact that drummers are the least frequent of the batch is such a shitty thing
and bassists too like if we can glamorize drummming more the art of it the
passion of it the groove of it the community of it then we can create a world
where people worship through drumming just like the Africans did and the cubans
the bembes and rumbas its so important to me this is my niche this will always
be my niche i love drums i love drummers and every time i sit at the kit i feel
like a kid again okay what else is there #soc

I don't feel like practicing right now. It's so fucking stressful and overwhelming and I'm not enjoying it. Dynamics practice fucking sucks. Trad practice feels pointless. And I don't give half a shit about Afro Cuban rhythms. I feel tortured trying to force myself to understand it every day when it feels so pointless and I have no drive to be better at it. It also all feels so fucking ambiguous. I'm tired of it. It's like my hand hurts and I'm scared and it feels too ambiguous right now. Like I understand that practicing these fucking accents is important. I think I'm actually just in a bad fucking mood. Mu is making it really hard too because she's got this sound coming from her stomach that's really fucking annoying and won't stop following me and everything itches too. And fucking Jackson wants to talk. I'm just so done. And I'm frustrated because I don't want to practice and want to practice at the same time and these dogs are driving me fucking crazy

I think I was just anxious about this conversation because now that we're talking I feel better

In thinking about #Her while wanking, I've realized it's the good things I fear. The tenderness, comfort, trust, and safety. The sense of belonging to something or someone. It's all I want, yet these are the things I'm most afraid of. It's like I'm imagining Her wearing me like a thong and gently rubbing me against her clit--done completely consensually--all I feel is a weight on my chest. A fear that I'm not good enough? Or no, it's more just like mistrust.

He walks and stands like He's always where he's meant to be #him

When he wants to play a show, he knows all the people (musicians, venues, engineers, etc) to make it happen on a whim and to make it successful for all involved #him

Difficult conversations are starting to appear in my head more and more as a mainstream. This is actually kind of fantastic feeling like I have the courage to act on these. Even not doing anything about them, it's nice to feel like I could and am becoming someone who does.

Borrowing from masturbation, it feels like the way to continue connecting with Her is to keep coming up with new ways or visualizations which fill me with the sensations that I had the first time. Like be more creative about it. Reliving the same ones eventually just desensitizes it. The mind needs new experiences. I feel like this is relevant everywhere, like the reason I frequently lose sight of the bigger picture seems to be caused by the fact that I try and continue reclaiming old memories of what I wanted a day or a week ago instead of constantly creating a new version of the truth. It's an attachment. The more I can imagine new situations involving Her, involving Him, and involving the future, the easier it's going to be to stay inspired and stay intent full.

The all/nothing principle: in black and white thinking with a narcissist, the extremity of self-criticality also determines how much of a victim they are. Spreading out responsibility among community lightens the load while also sharing the gratitude. This response can be helped by increasing self esteem (gratitude for Self) and external gratitude. My hypothesis is: can framing gratitude as a way to avoid pain for the narcissist pull them out of these cycles?

Doing a brain dump to get all the drum knowledge out and about

So there are typically 4 different clave pattern in Afro-Cuban music those are
the bembe rumba son and bombo each of them with a folkloric feel the bembe
started off in WEstern AFrica as a rhythm born from the bembes ceremony it's
not exclusive to the bembe tribe and was instead part of a diverse set of the
Yoruba tribes in west Africa the ceremony itself was a ritual full of
improvised singing and dancing but now im curious how the son and rumba were
derived exclusively anyways the part was typically spread out between 6
instruments but i dont remember what each of the instruments were blah blah
blah it was in 6/8 time and the rhythm was x.x..x.x.x.. so thats about it for
the bembe i guess theres more idk okay so the next one was the rumba another
folkloric rhythm that was thought to be derived from the bembe for the rumbas
ceremony, a ceremony that combined African whythms with either African or
Spanish HArmonies and was found in West Africa along with Cuba among other
places its a 4/4 variation of the bembe that goes like x..x...x..x.x... instead
of the 6/8 variation although if you hold them side by side they're about the
same and for the most part they are played the same like if you decide to swing
the rumba you basically get the bembe i dont think the rumba has any like
derived music that ive heard of so far though next theres the son clave also
called the salsa clave for its use in salsa music the son is from indigenous
Cuba Feature African Rhythms and Spanish Harmonines wheras the rumbas is a
ceremony of improvised song and dance the son has no ceremonial aspect that I
can recall but I might just be dumb about that the difference between the rumba
and son lies in one note which is x..x..x...x.x... yet this one note creates a
genre difference it makes me wonder how much this connects to the axioms of
math like are all genres derived from a single rhythm like a single pattern if
rumba is that one pattern and son is the other and bombo is the next yet
they've spawned such different genres with such different instrumentation it
seems like both of these genres are just explorations of an underlying pattern
an axiom of sorts if that's true then why were those ones specifically
developed maybe they're just what people gravitated towards in the same sense
like swing has the axiom of x..x.xx..x.x in 6/8 that's kind of a crazy
realization see this is why i love putting fields together okay anyways the
bombo is just the first bar of the son pattern so its x..x..x.x..x..x. over and
over again and its typically called the bombo because the second note is
accented by a drum called the bombo otherwise its just called the one bar clave
so from these patterns different instrumentation was used up until this point
and even further from this point none of this really involves a drum set these
are fundamental and theoretical axioms that spawn a genre the next component is
the palito and the cascara so the palito is a thin stick typically played on a
gua gua drum which i dont know what that is or what tha looks like i feel like
im finally starting to understand how this all pieces together and to an extent
I feel like this is my fault going in with a misunderstanding i use to do this
with math textbooks alot where it was like i went in not knowing what i was
getting into and at first would get frustrated without tryint to undersatnd or
get the bigger picture but its like when i come out to write about it or teach
about it it makes all of this so much easier to understand maybe thats the
teacher or maybe thats just me but i feel like i just dont pay attention to
what im reading ecause even in having the difficult converstaion yesterday i
feel like going back and reading how i couldve handled the situation better
makes the book actually beneficial like its not there for understanding so much
as reinforcement anyways yeah so the palito pattern is typically played
unaccented as R.LR.R.RL.R.RL.L where the right hand keeps the rumba pattern
further on the cascara pattern was plyaed by hitting the palito on the side of
the timbales (cascara means shell so hit the shell of the timbales) it holds
the same pattern as the palito except is done all on the right hand matched
grip, replicating this on the drum set is typically done by hitting the side of
the floor tom holy shit with the axiom thing i think i see that most good
drummers play a solo around a centralized rhythm or an axiom its about going on
a journey to discover this rhythm thats so sick so this is where i kinda forgot
everything i know that the cascara pattern is typically only played on the son
clave for salsa music, intermittent with conguears bongueras and bombueras i
think thats all that play congos bongos and bombos resprectivley bombo is also
still played here idk what else

So I'm doing shadow work right now on finance issues and it was a very different kind of resistance going into it like with the sex stuff it was all like very forbidden. This one is just feels like denial. It's like this feeling like there's not actually a problem and It's like a camouflage kind of problem and it feels like it's harder to understand it because I know it cuts kinda deep, but I don't know. I think what I've written out already was like I enjoy being at home like I enjoy being broke because like I mean, that's what I'm comfortable with. I know how to not spend money Like I don't want that to go away like if I become rich then it's like it's just all too easy to be mindless about everything to like fucking Spanish shit ton of money on stuff I don't need and I just I don't like that like I feel like it sucks like I like being broke. I like not being able to eat all the time you know not having to take care of myself all the way it's just it's so much easier to do all those things when I don't have money. It's just like I don't need an excuse. I just don't have to do it because I can't you know like I can't get go to therapy because I can't afford it. I can't you know get weird bumps checked out because I can't afford it. It's like I don't know. It keeps me. It's just a nice things before I have to. I like having that kind of bodyguard there that says no you may not enter. I feel like there's more I don't really understand it. I feel like this is kind of how always goes where it's like you get in and it's just like this confusing labyrinth, but I don't know. I think I just like it. You know it's it's fine. There's no expectation it makes me feel like I'm a kid again like I'm just staying at home. I don't have responsibility. It's freedom. It's just living how I wanna live. It's just I don't know. I guess evading responsibility. That's what it kind of feels like and I could tell him being judgmental about that too. It's like I mean, there's a lot I wanna do like I wanna move move it especially to West Coast, but like even just Tennessee somewhere where there is a lot more opportunity I wanna I don't know do all these things that are on my dream boards And I guess like not having money. It is kind of a crutch or scapegoat. I'm just I guess I'm just you're really scared of money maybe not so much having is everything that comes when I get it and I really enjoy just like taking advantage of people like this like Being able to have this excuse that oh I don't have money so I can't do that or I can't afford it it's easier than saying you're not a priority to me. You know like if I get money to take care of my dog and I have to get a house and I have to move out and I have to actually be successful. It's like I kind of like not having any of those things just like where I'm at. I don't like the challenge of any of it. It was the same reason I don't really want a girlfriend. It's like I like where I am you know I like graveling I like feeling like I'm less than everyone right now You know I like feeling like I'm 18 or 16 and going to school I like feeling irresponsible and like I only have to answer my parents kind of just like feeling like a failure there's no responsibility there. It's just people look at you and you're like oh yeah that's him. He just doesn't know what he's doing. You know you get away with so much more. I don't take care of my dog. I don't have my cat anymore. I don't pursue the opportunities I need to pursue I don't even go for the auditions. Don't really wanna change that I just I'm like not doing anything. I mean I'm doing stuff. I like feeling dependent you know cause then it's not my responsibility like if I can't afford something then I can suck on Mom's tits again like I was willing to have money for someone else but never really for myself not really want it like at this point. The only reason I want it is to give it back like I want a stream only so I can have bigger and better projects, but I never really wanna move on from where I am Creates like this obsession with like destroying everything I have you know throwing away stuff that I could sell or even donate if I have money and give it away. It's like it's not a bad thing. It's I tried to be generous, but I don't pay attention to my budget because I don't really care about them. I mean, I use them but Only because I have to it's not like for any self enjoyment. It's just because I know the consequences now if I don't, you know I've gone so deep into the debt before that I just don't wanna do it again it's like I wanna have money, but I really don't. I feel like it goes deeper to like I got on now I just I kinda like the failure. I like the idea that spare change isn't gonna take off and I'm afraid that this thing with Jackson in my nothing to extent that's why I don't really go out and meet people like I'm not looking for opportunities. I don't really want them. You know I don't wanna play with more people. I don't wanna make more money do it like a little bit at a time, but I don't even really feel like I can convince anyone that doing anything I mean I am and I think a lot of progress is made, but I don't like I don't care. I don't want the money Really care about it. Fucking stupid. I just wanna hit something. You know I don't want to worry about the rest of this, just wanna go to bed and I want to never have to worry about money again. I really really understand how to turn this around like I think I get the issue as I like The irresponsibility but that's kind of where it stops. I don't really know how to deal deeper. It's kinda like if I get money then all of a sudden you know it triggers no insecurity probably even triggers. My dad's makes me more attractive and it makes it so I have to be more of a dick. I just like feeling smaller than these people you know like I like making them feel big. It's like if somehow, I succeed and I make money doing all this and I make businesses then I've shrunk them and I've betrayed them especially my brother and my dad and also like my mom's whole side of the family like even the people that are rooting for me Few of them I see is being genuine, but like for the most part it just it feels like I'll be hated you know like I feel like anyone I've seen with money is just despised and maybe that's just because I surrounded myself with people so long that never had it to begin with and they've always despite people like that It's like I hate having money. I hate the responsibility and I hate you know the decision of where to spend it like the only reasons I really wanna have money for bigger projects or for paying other people like all I want money for us to give it away I mean to live too, but to get rid of it feel so much nicer and like I mean, I go back to this, but I don't know how to turn this around like to make it into anything positive because I really just don't even want it. I don't wanna deal with it. It's just so dumb like even the thousands I have in my bank account that should all go to debt. I hate looking at it. It looks much better at zero you know I felt easier when I had a low credit score, plus more fun to be poor, you know like the challenge of how cheap can I make this? How little can I spend this week? It's like it's fun. It's a fun challenge and I feel like everyone's gonna hate me. What's gonna wanna kill me and then I'm also gonna face like so much scrutiny from the public like if I succeed then I'm under a magnifying glass if I have money then everyone's looking at me I want attention but not that kind. I hate feeling this way. Also feels like like if I make money, there's all of a sudden this responsibility for me to pay for other people you know like if I can't stick up for myself then I'm paying for everything like I see a world where I could use it kindly like I could spend my money on other people for gifts And use like whatever I have to make the world a better place and bring more joy to the people around me comes that it cost like I could actually buy Mom flowers. I could get Dad a PS five I could buy shots for everyone except for people that don't drink I could Have good meals. I could have a professional team around me and actually give them what I feel like they deserve. I could have a mentor or coach I could afford to take a vacation or a day off. I could afford to go on a trip I could you know Joy a community I could go meet hiking friends and go backpacking with them or I don't know I could get a van I could get the studio I want, but I don't really want any of those things I just I wanna dream about them. You know the logistics of making them true just sounds stupid. I just I just wanna think about it. I don't really want it. I don't really want anything. Everything kind of feels like a burden. I just I don't wanna feel responsible.

- "The part of me that wants to be broke is really craving…"

A beer. Affection. A hug. To go fucking wild. To be free. To go backpack in the wilderness. To go buy a van. To go spend all of my money on useless crap. To see the bank account hit $0. Financial support. A dad that shows him how to use money, not how to abuse money. Compassion. Gas money. Someone else to control me. Someone to tell em what to do. Someone to tell me what the right decisions are, because I don't know what they are. Structure beyond my control. Something to remove my autonomy. Something to take over. A bath. Intimacy. The happiness that comes with secular attachments, overwhelming debt, and no one to love you. Being alone. The joy of starvation. My parents to take care of me for once. For them to pay attention to me. For them to not use financial triggers as a fucking lesson during deep emotional duress. 

If the "happiness" that my parents and grandparents experience is the consequence of a lifelong battle with money, what does it look like when it's not a fight?

I like feeling undervalued because then there's no expectations. I always over perform. It's always low stakes.

- "If I were fully broke, I would finally feel…"

Satisfied. Unburdened. Vindicated. I could finally show my parents that this is what you get for fucking me up so much. Free to commit whatever crime I wanted. I would feel *Free*. Makes me wonder if my desire for freedom is also a desire for freedom to others. Being free to them, financially. Indebted to them, in the way I already feel. That I was justified in feeling like I constantly owed other people for my existence. That all the bad behaviors I acted oblivious to were things I could continue. As small as I want to be. 

- "The fear I'm avoiding by wanting to be broke is…"

That's there's no one coming to save me. That I'm responsible for all my poor financial decisions. That I'm worth something and other people are actively taking advantage of my low self worth. That I'm worthless and everyone knows it. That I'm the only one responsible for my future. That my parents may never recognize the damage they caused me. That my friends and family will hate me. That being rich could be super fucking easy if I just tried a little bit. That the lifestyle I want is not compatible with being rich. That there are expectations of a rich person. That being rich means acting like a dick and being automatically perceived as being one just because you have money. That it'll separate me even more from people. That there is a humility in the rags that riches can't afford (#lyrics) I'll lose myself and my values in the money. That having money means I have to act a certain way. That I have no idea how to use money when I have it, and I don't want to have to learn. I'm afraid to get it because then I'm responsible for it like a plant or a pet or a child, I have to water it and tend to it and with my ambitions I don't know how to do that without killing it. It's easier to have no plants at all than to keep killing the ones I have. At least then, I don't have to grieve.

- "What I wish someone would say to me is…"

I will still love you when you're rich, just as much as when you were poor. I'll still let you dine on the floors if you want to. You're not greedy, but you're not free. You have value. You're worth so much to me. And I can't wait for the world to see that. They'll think the same thing. You can have as much as you want. Just ask, and I'll give you more. There's enough for all of us around, and knowing you, I know you'll make sure to spread it all. That's what makes you so powerful. That's what makes you worth so much. Even when you have it all, you give it all back for more. I love you for that. I can't wait to see what you make of the gifts I've given you. I know you'll use them wisely.

- If I had $1 million tomorrow but couldn't tell anyone about it--what would I do with it?
- If I knew I'd never be judged, what would wealth allow me to experience or create?
- What if money was the tool that let me mother myself in all the ways I was never mothered?
- What if being rich just meant I finally had the fuel to move at my own pace?
- What if the more money I have, the more generous, silly, grounded, and free I get to be?

Goals for today with Amanda
- Review I V vi IV progression (playing and theory)
- Learn ii, iii, potentially vii. Alternatively, alternating between G major and C major. Teach Am by having her figure it out (guide her through it)
	- Ask difference between major minor form
	- Show diagram of A
	- Ask her to point out the note that changes
- Learn blues form, including the significance of question question answer
- Get into tempo? Up stroke and down stroke probably
- Understand storytelling through form
Really need to keep more detailed notes on her progression so I can have recurring structures for any other student. But one thing that's going to really help my students is if I do visualization sessions where I get a grasp on what the next intentions are

How do I inspire/encourage her to continue practice in her time off? 
- Find challenges that put her in flow

I want a necklace to connect me to Her. Something that I can rub to connect.

Major resistances coming up to dealing with the financial stuff. I am concerned about not integrating the other things first. How can I deepen the integration?

Feel myself wanting to drink as a form of self sabotage now that success is drawing closer. #insight

EK Track 7 connects deeply to the Artists Way

Invited Nana and Grandpa out to coffee. Things are changing. With this new confidence, I'm inviting others into my world for much more intimate moments. It feels amazing. #progress I feel more connected than ever before. Like part of the reason I was able to invite them out and talk to them is I have this confidence in what I'm doing and the path I'm on. This inner security that I'm doing the right thing, and so their opinions matter much less

Once I master the bootcamp, I can turn around and sell the idea to other artists. #ideas #business Should be able to market it as a way to become profitable as an artists

I think the difficulty I have in marketing works under the assumption that I don't genuinely want others to succeed, or that I can't foresee it so the business is purely transactional. Because of this, starting the business feels greedy. I think envisioning the end goal for my clients will change everything. #insights #business

Not enough tutorials focus on the *why* which seems like the most important part. They describe the tool without explaining the purpose. Like in color grading, most videos explain *how* but never the purpose

Need to make a contract for lessons including
- Makeup policy
- Lateness
- Outline what is expected of them
- Outline what is expected of me

The Purdie Shuffle can easily be interloped with bembe

Why am I annoyed that she didn't even ask about the details of my difficult conversation

All I want right now is either sleep or practice

Spending money feels good in the same way that burning bridges does. What if I'm just resisting the desire to spend in the same way I'd resist the desire to admire women? I especially want to spend money on stupid short. Cards. Sweets. Or give it to other people. It just feels good to get rid of it. Sometimes I go to a store and buy something just to spend the money. It's under the guise of kombucha or protein or food or whatever, but a lot of times that pill is just to spend money. I only want more so I have more to spend. I like spending more than I have to for something.

I'm afraid to go deeper right now

Why is trauma such a turn on for me. Like I see pictures of her from a time she was being molested and it's activating this really dark kink. It's not a love, it's an ownership. Like she's *my* toy to play with. A side I've never really walked through before. // I don't fall into it anymore though. It's not as much of a turn on as a loving embrace.

Auto-AI generated pipeline for simple business ideas in my niche. See which one baits people in

I don't care about having $1000000. I care about making $10,000 a week. 

That Zach Izen shit fucked me up. I'm always looking to my dick for attraction, but it exists in so many other places. Mainly the heart. Like there's this one girl in Sopranos that is red headed, beautiful, and I have this unrelenting lust and desire for her. I can't stop looking at her and it gives me this warmth and comfort to see her. #insight #attraction they started having sex and the warmth immediately faded, but all the energy went to my dick. If I wasn't all tapped out right now, would've been really hard.

My distance between the things I care about (eg Mu, partners, plants) is an immediate reflection of my dad's lack of intimacy with me. Like my frustration with Mu's excitement when I get home had nothing to do with her and everything to do with seeing my dad frustrated when he got home from work and I was excited to see him. That's probably a big reason why I lost my enthusiasm, because it was constantly shut down as a kid. Now my body is conflicted by wanting enthusiasm but pre-rejecting it.

Having money = taking life too seriously; not being allowed to have fun. Being broke is safety. It's this barrier around me that protects me from life. I love it because it's low stakes. Once I have money, I have to learn how to actually use it. It's just so much easier to say something happens to me and I have no control over it. But once I get money, I have to move out. I have to get married. I have to have kids. I have to grow up. I no longer get to be mindful, get to be the kid I've always wanted to be. Being rich means I have to stop playing drums. It means I have to abandon everything I love. It means dangling a carrot on a stick over the people I love and care about, using and abusing them. It means I'm alone.

But what are the pleasures?

It lets Her take care of me. It keeps me small and I like being small. It keeps me from getting attention I want. 

There's something so *satisfying* about starving. Starving for food. Starving for attention. Starving for money. The less I have, the better. The less to grow attached to. The less to value. I feel free when I'm broke, because with money and power comes responsibility and accountability and I'm not ready for those things. I like being broke. I like when other people see me and think I'm free. There's a pleasant humility to it. Thinking i have no boundaries, that I'm whatever they want me to be. It's not freeing to my Self, but it's freeing to explore the world like that. To be open and spontaneous. That's what it means to be broke. It means She gets to own me, and never has to let me go. That if She lets go, someone else could take me super easily, so She has to hold on for dear life or that I will always belong to someone. It's like a warm blanket that keeps me safe and suffocates me at the same time.

I'm intimidated by #Her. I noticed it when Hadley (cute girl) walked into Starbucks. There was feeling of intimacy present. Playfulness and horniness, but fear. Like I wanted to shrink or hide myself. I've been better today about noticing how I want to show up. How I want to connect with people and initiate things. I really need to figure out how to ritualize, or structure, my growth with all this integration. Some way to constantly remind myself what I'm trying to become, and a way to constantly keep in my mind Her presence and His presence. #He is who I want to be. #She is who I want to be with. There's so much safety and comfort when I feel Her. But allowing those emotions to be present was a huge growth moment.

Should habitualize calling friends to catch up

He knows everyone in the room before he enters. When he doesn't, he instantly makes friends with everyone in there. There's a noticeable shift in the air when he's around. A playfulness. An aura that everyone is magnetized to. #Him

# 05-18-2025

Feeling a lot of residual stress from digging in here and also feeling rushed. All that didn't get accomplished:
- ~Workout~ particularly knee workout
- Ritual formation
- Solution to money issues
- weekly planning

I enjoy other people's drum solos. Why would someone else not enjoy mine? It's not an ego thing if it's what the music calls for.

There's this weird piece in like being in a crowd Kinda like you could say anything like no one's really listening or paying attention they might be people watching, but no one hears anyways I was thinking again about getting back into what I was talking about. See if anything else is coming up now but I'm not sure he's super hungry. I'm waiting to eat or really just waiting on my parents to get over here so we can all eat no one his girlfriend are sick so they're not coming anymore. Yeah I don't know where to get started again. I don't even really remember too much of where I left off just like I don't know it's it's weird. I feel like I understand more than the spending habits and the joy in doing it they're definitely is like a kind of sexual thrill to it. I guess I don't know. I understand like the aspect of it like I only really won't spend money to kind of create that tension. It's like every time I spend it. It's like the same with masturbation I guess it's like releases that tension that's been building up like the more money. I have you know the more it's feels like attention. It's like a damn waiting to burst. I just weird. I'm trying to understand it more but I really just don't like I think I see that there are ways which I've neglected to continue growing you know like I think about parking garage and Highway 49. It's like the bands. I'm in our progressively getting better. Oh Aunt I don't know. I forgot about them, but they're getting better each time. I join a new one and so that's good but it's like each time it's I'm essentially in them until it's not really a challenge anymore or at least like for Highway 49 in parking garage both of them it was like once it stop being a challenge I stop wanting to be in it The patio it was that I I don't think I ever let it challenge in the way that needed to you know like with the one with parking garage. The challenge was to make them sound good even when I didn't think they were good or where I was frustrated with their talent And with Highway 49 it was like they were already great and I was at a time where I was understanding more of like I need to learn the original part and I think I had to learn that lesson from patio, but I don't feel like I learned how to be a good drummer for patio because I didn't take on the challenge of Really learning the music from like a groove and emotional standpoint and I think now I understand that's a big part of what I have to do and it's like moving forward. I feel like the more adult thing I'm going to have to do is go find bigger groups to play with where I have to become more grain not with just with their music but the genre around their music You know that feels like the more professional thing to do, but this is all besides the point like it still doesn't touch any of the stuff that we talking about earlier like all the money shit and I feel like I piled way too many things onto that to deal with because really the only thing I really need to deal with today is planning the week out which I haven't done and I don't think I'm gonna have time to do because I'm dealing with this shit instead don't get me wrong. This is important. It's just not important or important and urgent like I should be dealing with planning because I need that to have a good week and understand why I didn't have a great week last week so I don't know I mean the thing that keeps coming back to my head was Amazon gone you know my job at the school you know the potential management position that they want me to have it's like I think to an extent the reason none of them worked out is because I didn't have Any end goal with them like I wasn't using them to grow in any sense I just had them because I don't know I got them I guess even to an extent I just took them because they offered money or because someone told me that it was the right thing to do It's like a fucking hate money man. I feel like the more talk about it tomorrow. I just realize there's just heat up aggression around it and just like repressed feelings especially around my dad. It's always seems to be the case. Feels like kind of a cop out at this point I don't understand any of it. I'm frustrated like even getting here all I wanted to do something like go buy a treat or something it's like the same as masturbation. It's it's fucking foreplay tension. It's like I have no endurance to resist it and I don't even do it with intention like I don't really spend money with the intention Of I guess bettering myself same reason that like I don't really masturbate with intention, I'm trying to but for so long, I think I've just done it a autonomously. I don't even really think about it. I just do it because I want to feel good or you know something turns me on Like I think with all this other stuff I'm trying to properly feel it and understand why I'm feeling it I don't know I guess maybe there's an element of like I feel rejected with money. There's this other thing where it's like I feel like every time I do this I go really emotional with it. I got really deep with it and then I come back and I have a solution but this time it still feels like I don't really have anything Like I don't understand it any better it's just I don't like money I like spending it. I don't like having it. I feel like it's just a shitty thing. I don't want it. I don't want it to have anything you know like feel like everything should just be free, which is a very stupid thing. It's like maybe the issue is more that I just don't value anything you know so like I can't value myself I can't value someone else because I don't really value anything like everything is just exist. That shouldn't be more or less expensive so it's like it feels so arbitrary. It's like a weird number. There's no sentimental value to it. It's just a number that somehow defines you and I really just like despise that kind of system. You know it's like I get you know do something that fixes people's lives. I think I'm just born been born into an era Where some people make it so easy to make money by profiting off of like weakness you know I've seen so many fucking like YouTube ads or Instagram ads or something for just bullshit. You know like hats or T-shirts or you know quick fix solutions to someone's problems and it's like It's hard to trust that money means anything anymore. It's just it doesn't seem to have any actual significance you could have a millionaire who is a piece of shit it's like how did they contribute so much to society and you know like why am I poor when people tell me that I'm so valuable to them And why is it that like someone that's a piece of shit who cares about nothing but themselves can be rich like I don't know I don't understand the value up at all like what does it even mean to be worth something you know especially like when you're supposed to live in a way that you don't compare yourself to other people then what is value even mean like what does it mean to be worth something? If you're not supposed to compare yourself? Is it just some fucking made up number like if I suddenly said I'm worth $1 million is that true? Who's to say that it's not true if that's how much I value my time I don't know it doesn't make sense to me Like how are you supposed to see yourself as valuable without comparing yourself to someone else like I'm I'm assuming that everything that I have tied to money, you know like the responsibility that having to grow up and like mature and pretty much anything else that I'm using as a excuse to not make money like I'm assuming that I've put those things on a pedestal that I can never reach you know or that maybe not I can't reach so much as I'm using money as an excuse not to do those things you know not to grow up because like I guess I know from an emotional standpoint that those things are my personal limitations outside of those limitations like what does it mean to be worth anything? It doesn't make sense to me like it's it's something that other people have to define for you. It feels like and it's like how can I do any kind of like emotional kink work or how can I do any kind of like mental therapeutic work to accept my value if there's no number for that, and this is where I guess I'm just like really confused.

> You don't hate money.
> You hate how it's been used to silence the most alive parts of you.

Delaying the spending of money is a form of foreplay. The longer I go without spending, the more I desire that sweet release.

I'm on a hike right now and I'm trying to. I've got two goals today and one is to really uncover my money issues maybe to a deeper level I don't know if I'll get to the core of it today. That's cool mushroom out here. and another goal of mine is to come up with ways to ritualize everything with I guess just everything I've been dealing with recently because it feels like it feels like changes are happening like I planted the seeds and they're kind of growing and allowing to be to be who I want to be, but I guess I just want a more structured way to do it. I don't know maybe doing reviews is all I really need to do to have the kind of continuity I want but it'll be nice at least brainstorm so back to the money stuff. It's weird going out and hiking and feeling like I'm only here to solve problem instead of enjoy what I'm doing makes it feel like I should've done something else even though I love nature I don't feel like I'm being mindful out here isn't a huge issue. Oh I had my first one hour long meditation. Today was pretty good money I found this one to be a pretty hard one to get deep with you know I keep trying to go deeper understand it more, but I don't feel like I ever encounter anything like most of the time. It just feels like kind of grasping at straws like I think the part I understand is that I haven't allowed myself to enjoy. You know the scarcity or I don't know a bunch of other parts of it. It's like I feel like every time I take these steps like shit keeps getting better and away like I finally made a blog post and I don't know. I really need to finish recording the drum video because once I do that like I'll have another video to upload and it's like I'm getting better at building this kind of marketing funnel that I'm working on, but it's still you know it's still taking time to do. It's like I don't think it's necessarily bad thing I just I don't know the parts of it that frustrated with our that I still don't really have anything to sell people like I have an idea for a Boot Camp and I have the people I want to target and to help but I don't really have anything aside from that so it's I don't know. I feel like I keep getting distracted by things too, and like I can't tell if it's because I don't really have much focus today or if there's just a lot of resistance to this issue because something else it's like everything else it felt so easy to tackle you know it was like I knew exactly what I needed to look at in order to feel it but it's like with money. It's like in order to understand it better I have to spend money or I have to. I don't know look at other things. It's just it's complicated like I guess. I know that I don't know how to improve on this and like I think this has been my struggle for like the past year and a half to two years is like like I don't even really understand the pattern or what causes it or anything like that like the best bet I have it's just that I'd like the irresponsive like I don't like having to be responsible for anyone other than myself you know I don't it's like money is a very easy barrier to everything else in life like it keeps me from having to get married or have kids or move out of my house or take care of myself even most of the time like it keeps me from having the responsibility of taking care of a house and rent and a mortgage and you know building a business and and all these other things it's like the longer I stay poor or the smaller I get to be the less I actually have the responsibility to be other than anything other than you know me it's like I keep coming to the conclusion, but it doesn't feel like anything. It just feels like matter of fact it's like if I look. I don't know. I think when I look at it, it does really feel like it is kind of concentrated around elementary middle school. You know all the issues I mean in general just seem to from there like the one memory that keeps popping up over and over again is the Zach Izen thing and I don't even really know how that relates to money I think that's just the attract stuff but I mean I think everything else it's just I don't know like it feels like money is this excuse to not grow up and I feel like that's something that's run through my head for a long time and so I guess I'm just asking you know like what if it is but if that's the truth if I'm using it as this barrier to keep me from having to you know become an adult you know to keep me from having to find the older version of what I want to become, you know like not just like a Drummer but a drummer that contributes to something and that builds a better world and shit like that it feels like everything from when I was a kid just feels unresolved like there's this part of me that never really got to be alive or to be a kid and I just it feels like all of my 20s have been spent running from that. It's like when I get money I suddenly have to become like my dad and he looks miserable. I mean he looks better but he still looks like he doesn't want to do what he does and it's just like I don't see how any of it's fair that I didn't get that kind of attention. You know I didn't have anyone stick up for me and really have anyone show me how I don't know fun responsibility could be the benefits of it. You know it always seems like everything about my dad's life burdened him and I was just one of those burdens. It's like peace by peace. Everything about me just got chipped away like I wanted to be the excited kid enthusiastic, friendly social loved supported and push to pursue my own dreams instead, I was just like a responsibility someone to take care of it's like they didn't want to even wanna be there. You know I never really got to be that version of me. It's like I don't know. It's like if I feel like if I did then I probably would've just become a programmer or Guitarist. Maybe I would've made games. Maybe I would've appreciate that you tried to build a safe place for me to live and meet to grow and my brothers know and I think my mom tried like they tried their best. What they had. It's like I'm conflicted because I don't wanna sound ungrateful. I just I am really fucking mad about this you know that I feel like my childhood was taken from me my parents they saw me as like wiser, more mature, so like I didn't get taken care of it's like yeah he can do it himself never wanted to just it kept me like fucking emotionally crippled. It's like now they all see me as this healthy person you know mentally healthy mentally sane figure cause I do so much of this shit and I take care of myself, but I still like still need to feel that way like someone wants to take care of me pay for me you know not to reject me have to keep putting me into places where I'm not wanted just because it's your fault fucking desire for me to be that way like all that's resulted and has been putting me into these situations. Where like might leaders are terrible role models they're absent. I don't know I think about that one time my dad bought the rifle the men's retreat you know like constantly said no to all of our stupid shit to when my mom wanted to buy something all the sudden when he wanted something it was in the budget just like the hypocrisy of it. It's like even if it hurts everyone else if I spend money on me then it's OK even if it's not in the budget you fucking integrity there I feel like it connects to the brat, you know it's such a close connection of like I need attention. You know I want attention and maybe it's just another way that I try to get it by being poor or it's like I don't know it's related to both of them. It's like like I don't have money in a way to like shrink myself down like I'm looking for someone to take ownership of me and buy everything for me and treat me well and worry about money for me. I'm looking for someone to take like all the work out of it pressure off you know like I don't always wanna have to be the one in charge of my life or of other people's lives. It's like a constantly am know I think that's why things haven't worked out all it just like I haven't always found people who wanna lead as much as I do. It's like I think that's why something with Jackson might actually work is because we both have that kind of motivation to push through whatever the fuck it is we have going on to build something or to make something or create something like we both have such creative energy and we're not afraid to be vulnerable about it and I get the same feeling from Josh is more. I think I'm getting sidetracked. Makes me wonder if all the money stuff really is just the brat stuff in a different line light or Spotlighters different light like if it's like a way of getting a fucking break from all things I didn't get to not experience. It's finally like having someone else to take responsibility for me or account for me or help me save me or something. Take my pain away without blaming me for it. No stop trying to push me back in the fire when I went out of it. Like all I want is just to be the child that I never got to be where to have a space for him to exist and explore and make mistakes and find self and shit like that. I don't I don't feel like I got that, I feel like I was living someone else's life And I had to put on masks for everything I did at home constant mask like now all I want is just the freedom to enjoy myself you know no responsibility no wisdom no authority no adult maybe I just enjoy the struggle to do that. Just enjoy you know being everyone else's slave You are not having a say in my own life just because that's how it's always been. It's kind of insightful maybe I just like the pain there maybe I'm just so used to having other people dominate me that I can't control myself and that the time I try, I crashed and burned you know like Like I remember everything with Amazon in Oregon it being like like with Amazon they finally were gonna just pay me like a lot of money I remember being stressful there but I remember feeling so good to have that it was like I could suddenly just have the things I wanted what I wanted them I could afford to do whatever I want I could you know, but even when I had that I still saved so much of it for for what I mean I guess so. I could make the mistakes I made later, but it was the same with Aragon like suddenly I was getting paid a lot to do exactly what I was doing at the school but in a much like Moore gratifying capacity and I fumbled, I threw it away. You know like I didn't take advantage of it at all. I mean, I think I mean part of it was because I genuinely didn't enjoy what I was doing, but I don't think that's the big thing it's like I told everyone I didn't care about the money, but it wasn't that I didn't care about it like I didn't Want it. I didn't feel like I deserved it. You know like it felt too easy and like after that, I just kept downgrading myself. Maybe it was good at what I did I have no idea but like I don't know I think I shut those things down because I didn't want the money. I didn't like having it. I didn't like that suddenly things felt easy you know all the sudden know it's gonna be making over $100,000 off the bat people thought I was good enough what I did I don't think I've ever really processed that. Maybe that's where I have to look like Why like if we take away responsibility and stuff like that like if I had 100,000 right now I think it's like the same stuff I thought about yesterday's like I don't know what to do with that money like if I all of a sudden get it it's like I become Responsible in a different way like I don't feel like I have authority to do something good about that I mean, what if it meant that I could give to charity constantly and buy gifts for my friends what if that's all I needed to make everything I wanted to happen You know like what if I've just been struggling in debt for no fucking reason like even last year, I was good enough to teach people or grow business or something like that like I think the reason I keep shy away it's not because I'm making mistakes because I just don't want the money You know like I like the struggle. I don't want it to be easy. It's like all these things feel true, but they don't feel true. I don't understand it at all. I don't get it. Why did I turn down the money like there was so many other circumstances to it but at the end of the day they wanted to pay me I mean, I think a lot of it was just I didn't think I was good enough for it like I didn't like the pressure put me under the sun. Someone thought I was worth $100,000 a year, but I didn't think that like it's always such a good feeling getting money Like when I have it's great. I guess I just don't trust myself to do something good with it which I mean in the past, I think it's true because I didn't used to spend it on anything meaningful but now I try to donate to charity I gifted to friends Spend it on projects know it's not materialistic things I try to spend it to grow the world invested in things that I think are good. I just I think a lot of people see something in me that I haven't been able to see in myself like there's some kind of value that I have that I guess I think everyone has And maybe you know that's the one thing I'm strong at that is valuable. I don't know. Maybe it really is just a question of my strengths and not knowing them cause like Starbucks wants me to be a manager. You know our God wanted me a school wanted me to get a PhD Seattle or I mean Amazon wanted me to be a programmer but like I don't believe for a second that really had to do with programming like I think in all these things I just had to do with my ability to be logical. Yeah would be good at problem-solving California tenacity maybe I feel like this is besides the point I still feel like there's something I'm not seeing here and I'm frustrated because I also feel like I need to work on other shit and this is taking this is taking too long. The voice recording doesn't get this but I'm laughing about that. I kind of wonder if like the way that my dad was raised has anything to do with it you know like I think about the fact that my dad came from my grandpa when he didn't have money you know they grew up. I don't think they grew up poor but they didn't grow up having a lot so she might have that same sense of scarcity that he had growing up and then when he became an adult, he was surrounded by people that had much more than him you know like all of his friends I want to come on, went to become much more successful or maybe not successful so much as they just there Careers had higher profit higher value something like that or maybe they just value themselves more and so he makes a lot, but he doesn't act like he makes a lot. Maybe that just passed off. I feel like I'm going in circles here. I'm going fucking nuts. I need to take a break. #soc

Something I'm learning is that Artists Dates don't give the fulfillment I need when I go into them with a task. Like today, loading my schedule with mental health work took away almost all my mindfulness.

What if I only took jobs that aligned with my professional development? Like constant challenge to my growth? I feel like that is the mature artist thing, especially since for so long it' been difficult to reconcile my joy with how I want to develop personally as an artist

Write an album where each song is just the evolution of a simple pattern, an exploration of how to make it dance

What if making more money is just a way of improving my love for spending? Like in the case of attraction, removing my resistance.

One improvement I've noticed so far in the integration of ownership is I'm becoming less enticed by the power dynamic and more drawn to the feeling of love in sex.

I'm actually pretty good at "ordering" people around when I need to

What would I need to charge 1000? 10000?
- I'm home residency 
- Every step to transform their life from employee to artist 
- transcendental drum experiences 
- Perfect band matchmaking 
- Profitable artist guaranteed 
- Drum setup and tuning
- Selling a complete lifestyle transition rather than just learning drums

A lot of resistance came up when David started offering lessons on my behalf. Also, the joy of spending money is what increasing my urges to get coffee, weed drinks, food, etc. I really just want to spend money right now. It's interesting, it's like this book and the other books work on a basis of just bringing more awareness into my life.

Now that I'm out of H49, I'm free to network at more professional events.

I really just wanna work on this money stuff. Or broke persona. But I'm so tired. Tomorrow, it'll be a much bigger priority to deal with shit.

But probably one of the biggest changes right now is using masturbation as an opportunity to observe my desires. It's interesting understanding the difference between attraction and eroticism. Almost like those erotic feelings are never guaranteed, but my attraction increases erotic desires.
