# Quarter 2: The Grief That Sowed The Seeds

April started in grieving the departures of Andy and Jaida, the potential
departure of Brandi, leaving Highway 49, and the death of my great aunt Lydia.
I began losing myself in the grief, slowly but steadily losing all motivation
to eat, sleep, practice, and meditate, resolving to obsessive journaling about
all my detachments (especially with Brandi), masturbating, and mindless
entertainment. Anything for a hit. The devastation was excruciating. I forgot
everything I'd learned about dealing with these emotions over the past two
years. And yet, it was the catalyst I needed to initiate bigger career moves. I
couldn't stand being stuck at Starbucks any longer, so I recruited my first
student. Soon to follow was a second. And finally, I made it known that I don't
work for free anymore. I became a professional in the ashes of everyone who
left.

Still, the potential departure of Brandi haunted me more than all the others.
Existential Kink opened my eyes to how greatly I'd attached to her and how much
she'd align with my sado-masochistic desires. When I thought the obsession
couldn't get any worse, I collapsed under the weight of my deeper wound from
being severed at birth. I was desparate for her in the following week. I became
more aware of the ways I've used attention, affection, and vulnerability as
tools for manipulation. The guilt and pride became just as overbearing as the
grief, I had to get away. During my family's vacation, I threw my phone behind
a bookcase to detach. I rehabilitated for a week. During this time, I journaled
excessively, but very differently. Where before I was doing it out of
compulsion, now I was remembering how freeing journaling can be when it isn't
done to feed ChatGPT. I listened for what felt like the first time in 3 months,
and I found myself again. In the calm, I found Her too: The Muse. Someone I'd
heard of, but never met. And soon after, I met the Siren. In both cases, I
began understanding how much their influences had impacted every aspect of my
life, especially how my desire for the remorseless Siren was always a
reflection of the pains I'd had to find pleasure in to survive.

Returning to and identifying more with The Muse has brought me back to my Self.
The exercise, diet, practice patterns, and creativity have all returned, along
with a new drive to grow my life from a perspective of love and joy rather than
as a means of escaping pain. I'd struggled with this issue for over a year, so
the boon that I'd been given in Her presence has inspired me to be more of this
world instead of in it. With that, the grief has subsided, the guilt has been
lifted, and there is a wholeness within that I've never experienced before. And
it's all thanks to Her.

## 3 Shifts I Witnessed in Myself

1. Found Her, began aligning in a way that serves Her better, and looking for pleasure in love instead of pain.
2. Gained a much greater confidence, to the point of being able to hold eye contact, flirt openly, and open vulnerability with people
3. Increased my extroversion to the point of hosting the first camping trip and actually starting the business, seeing this now as a plant I maintain

## Structures Built / Systems Strengthened

The main structure was this more methodical breakdown of my review methods. It
focuses now on the more overarching story and points of growth rather than
specifically on problem/solution. This helps it to build in a way that's less
mechanical, while still allowing for mechanical solutions. It also takes alot
of the time out of it.

The other primary structure has been my lessons program and openness to
teaching. A refinement to how I organize my practice sessions as well.

## Persistent Shadows or Resistance

- The Siren is the most persistent one at this point, and it's the most degrading to my lifestyle. It structures all my relationships as being from pain rather than joy. 
- My social life is still plagued by pride and defensiveness. The Muse is making me aware of how life could look if I opened myself up to people, but I haven't gotten there yet. 
- Lack of confidence in how I look and how I maintain the world around me, including my studio, my fashion, cleanliness, and my body. Connected to the last point I bet.
- Difficulty taking breaks

## Quarterly Ritual or Recommitment with Him

> Hereâ€™s what I want to do differently next quarter

The next quarter, my biggest desire is growing my community in a way
that preserves my authenticity. This is for myself as much as it is
the business, but finding a way to grow this by being more connected
with what I already do (ie meditate, exercise, and practice) is
something I feel connects me more to Him than ever before. Showing up
more in the world as myself and opening myself up to others, whether
online or in person, is what Ifeel like will accomplish this.
Meditating more, eating better, etc are paramount. And I think the
best way to accomplish these things is to surround my inner circle
with Masters who can lead the way.

## Goals for next quarter

1. Get $3000 in a month from drums (lessons students, gigs, etc) and realize Her studio (walls, floors, cameras, EKit)
2. Run 10 miles
3. Transcribe 100 songs(solos) for drums
