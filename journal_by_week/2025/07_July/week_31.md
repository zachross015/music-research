It does feel different. I sat this time and asked myself what I was actually feeling, listed it all out to myself then said it to Her. I almost started crying. But afterwards, the urge to finish started fading away. I just wanted to be held, coddled, and treated the way my mom treated me as a baby. To experience that love again. It's a super power I've been noticing more in my mom and I've been trying to hone that more. But in a lot of these fantasies now, I start remembering moments when I was an infant. Being held that way, being that small and that loved. The way she treated me is something emulated in all my relationships. I've tried to tap into that more, and yesterday even through the stress, I felt tapped into it when taking my dog to the hospital. All of today, I've been reaching for that comfort, it's this feeling like "I've got you now. I may not be paying attention to you, but I love you and I'm caring for you and it brings me comfort to know you're touching my skin" #lyrics

Trying to really observe right now to sense how burn out comes. I'm so exhausted today from the hospital last night and opening this morning. My intention for the day is to recognize this exhaustion and attend to it so that the rest of my week can go back to normal, but I'm also recognizing that the exhaustion itself leads to coping mechanisms of masturbating, over eating, and mindless entertainment. All of them are escapes that I fall into and I'm trying not to this time, but I think the real solution is just to attend to the rest first.

What am I feeling right now?
- Exhausted 
- Scared
- Panicked from the sudden pains
- Frustrated about the financial setbacks
- Angry at Mady
- Angry at my parents for not even offering to help cover costs
	- Frustrated that I'm even thinking about that when mom broke her wrist and both of them let me live here rent free
- Worried that this will cause me to fall off the horse again
- Worried that this won't be the last time

Beginning to prioritize experience over finance, detaching from financial insecurity. Noticed this last night when paying for Mu's hospital bill. There was actually a lot of progress moments. I paused and confronted the doctor on components of the bill, asking what each was without getting aggravated. When she was injured, I took her straight to the hospital. I constantly prioritized her comfort over my entertainment, staying present and with her throughout instead of working through my own tasks. On the way, I still found beauty in the sunrise and in the morning I found beauty in the nostalgia from driving back from gigs. All in all it feels like I've begun prioritizing the health and wellbeing of loved ones over financial setbacks, realizing that that's all they are. #progress

For once, I feel like it's possible to sell my services. As a challenge more than anything. If I can get good enough at just selling drum lessons, then the sky is the fucking limit. In feeling this, I realize how much of Influence and $100m offers are definitions of the skill sets which make it basically a guarantee #inspiration

Need to dig deeper into weight stuff today

I don't know how to find better people than me to surround myself with. At the same time, I feel like I'm blind to it. Maybe from desire. Because when I went to midtown the other day, I saw 3 bands playing on the sidewalk. What's stopping me from making friends with them? It feels like it's connected to the same resistances that came up in Elementary school, being rejected by them. Only making friends with the outliers or people I had "control" over.

Driving in to pick up Mu from the hospital at 2:30 AM, this crazy thing has happened where I missed the night drive feeling. There's a peace to it. It reminded me of coming home from gigs and I miss that feeling so much. I need to get one together

Was conflicted on masturbating to sadistic fantasies last night (compulsively) and body ended up defaulting to a more loving one. Still being stepped on but from a place of safety, comfort, belonging #progress

I desperately need to sit with the pain of dog at the hospital in the $1200 invoice because I've noticed this time the instinct to move towards dopamine. Immediately after I went and got two donuts I ate three ribs. I played video games for hours and I compulsively masturbated so it's obvious that this incident has brought up some pain and this time I would rather deal with it than allowed to continue acting like this.

Trying to provide the quality of work I bring to Starbucks to my life is also a game changer. Like in taking care of my relationships, it helps to be responsible for the purity of this space. Doing dishes. Taking trash out. For them, but mainly for me. It makes it feel much better around here and it's like...creating room for it feels much more important. Having downtime for them and holding myself more responsible for the purity of this space. It's about being a productive member of this house and a productive member of society

Holy shit, daily intentions are the solutions to like 99% of my problems. Starting the day in a way that says "this is what I intend to do" creates a habitual alignment with my plans that makes it so much easier to stick with them. Like to say "I intend to spend less than $20 today" makes it easier to say what was my intention. It's such a fucking simple way of reminding myself to stick to a budget or a diet or something In a way that fills me with that daily vigor. Fucking life changing. And the best part is it feels like everyday I have a way of saying that I reached my goals for the day. It makes even rest days feel productive, because I'm meeting the day with intention. #insights #lessons #intentions

Drama is just social dirtiness. Social clutter.

Resisting doing the work it would take to actually believe in myself, which would help sales as much as drums

Rejection then retreat technique is a really important one to remember. #influence
- Reciprocity 
- Perceptual contrast

Would be good to look at other sales channels and see what techniques are being used.


> The additional advantage of the technique is not really a psychological principle, as in the case of the other two factors. Rather, it is more of a purely structural feature of the request sequence. Let's once again say that I wish to borrow $10 from you. By beginning with a request for $20, I really can't lose. If you agree to it, I will have received from you twice the amount I would have settled for. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat to the $10 favor that I desired from the outset and, through the action of the reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my likelihood of success. Either way, I benefit; it's a case of heads I win, tails you lose.

The ethical side of this is genuinely wanting to give them the highest experience possible (most expensive), but making concessions to meet them where they are.

What offer can I come up with prior to lessons to make them seem more worthwhile? OR can I offer lessons then have a second tier option to offer people? #sales #influence #marketing

Remember, the stuff from $100m offers didn't start blooming until a year after. It's possible everything from influence can start impacting me, but it probably won't be until another year til it starts having results. Since that's the case, wouldn't it make sense to read as much as I can and allow it all to sink in over time?

Intentions for today:
- Finish recovering. Read influence during breaks.
- After work, no video games. Mental health work and chill so I can get back on the right track tomorrow.
THIS IS HOW TO TAKE BREAKS AND REST MINDFULLY. It requires setting intentions at the start of each day, recognizing what is possible. Working with the day/week/month instead of trying to force it to fit. Like today, I get done with work at 5:30, but the boundary I set for myself is no drum after that. If my work schedule keeps shifting that can change, but the general rule is no heavy focus 2 hours before bed. Saving money and eating healthier can also be heavily reinforced that way, as well as other goals. I think a lot of it now revolves around needing to trust that I CAN get back on the ball pretty easily if I attend to my needs first. Recognizing yesterday that a lot of my resistances came from lack of sleep was super important.

Amanda's message to me playing guitar on the beach is the exact opposite of Elena. 

Even now, I find myself falling into the same numbing behaviors. Video gaming today, "shame" eating during lunch. Anything to quell the stress.

Okay so like what are all the honest feelings I have about Spare Change?

I dread gigs with them. The music is good, but as people it's the same woe as me attitude as I felt with Amy and Jess and Brandi. I don't feel inspired to grow with them. I hate having to drive for them. I hate the effort I have to expend for them. I hate feeling like if I'm not doing anything the band isn't progressing, and in the same way holding the band back by not showing the enthusiasm I expect from them. I'm mad at myself for never choosing to prioritize them. I hate how this looks for future bands and future relationships, because I've done so much work to convince myself that if it were the right people then I would put all my effort into it and I'm scared that I'm waiting for the right people to put absolutely any effort into and I villainize them but it's this really fucking confusing middle ground where I can't figure out if I'm the problem for not putting effort in or if I've stopped putting effort in because it stopped being rewarded and I just fucking hate how this looks for my life and my career if I'm looking for any reason to not play live shows because I know live gigs terrify me much more than I let off but I also love them and I haven't done it in a while and I miss it but I hate it and it's like I want to start auditioning for bigger and better gigs soon but why should I deserve those if I won't even practice for the gigs I have it's just so fucking frustrating because I constantly come to this dilemma of like would this band actually work if I tried or is it a fucking waste of time? Are they self sabotaging or am I? And I love them as people but I've now experienced what it's like to be part of a completely synergistic team which would stop at nothing to be amazing and it doesn't feel like I can do that with them like they'll never have that level of standard and I put it all on myself some part of me feels like the resolution is to commit to what I have and if I try hard enough and put enough energy in it might motivate them to do the same but another part of me thinks I need to just keep looking for people who are already driven like that and this other part that thinks I won't find that until I prove to the universe that I'm capable of putting my energy into something even if it doesn't pay anything and I feel unmotivated by almost like I have to clear this hurtle where I prove to the universe that even surrounded by people who don't motivate me I can survive and motivate and carry the team I have without giving them any credit but then another side of me says that's fucking stupid and abusive and it's the hard way and I'm so confused about it all that I can't stop stress eating and playing video games I can't prioritize what actually matters to me and it's all fucking dumb

Why is there so much resistance with spare change now?
- Feel like I deserve better
	- Ego or emotion? I don't feel inspired by them. Love jamming but it feels like a drama or a weight. A lot of unprofessional behavior and complaining
- Blanket resistance to live performance that is starting to become more and more apparent. Like is it them, or is it me? Is it because they don't inspire me or because I'm terrified of live performance?

I don't trust that Elena enjoyed what we were doing. Why? 

I'm insecure on playing my actual kit. Why? 
- loudness triggering dad
	- Remembering being unable to stand up for myself against his aggression and Griffin

Rushed this morning by trying to fit too much stuff in. Result was I skipped setting and aligning with intentions in meditation, skipped warm up during workout, and video games for an hour. I think half of it was due to packing things in, the other half was emotional fallout from Elena dropping. What could I have done better?

 Need to make systems charts for teaching workflow

One way I could do group lessons is really just include people on my journey, do assigned listening and reading. Or even, once I've gained enough experience doing transcriptions, offer stuff like lessons in exchange for stuff life transcriptions #ideas #business alternative is to just post reels of my own analysis of songs as I go through them, like recording my process of transcriptions and talking about it #reels

Brandi and Kevin have been making me realize the power I have. Both are like begging for another camping trip, and the fact that I'm the one they come to without doing anything on there own is making me feel like I'm a reality shaper

All it takes to build the business is letting people know

What I noticed with Julian (District Manager) coming in today:
- I THRIVE under the pressure of authority, especially someone whose focus I align with and who I feel challenged to perform well under
- that fills me with enthusiasm to share with the team
- When it leaves, my ability to share my energy goes with it
It's not that my enthusiasm doesn't exist, it's that it's unreciprocated. I noticed that a lot during the fucking massacre on the floor today. I kept trying to put the vibes out and no one gave them back, whereas I remember during the Jaida times w Andy and Tristan and all, they were constantly given back. It's another area that shows how much ENVIRONMENT and INNER CIRCLE matter. The team matters. And if 
I can find this kind of inner circle and enthusiasm in music then there's no telling how far I'll go. I need that energy that Knower has

I see the spiral this time. What do I need to do to make sure it doesn't go any further? Is it as difficult as resisting all the temptations or as simple as sitting with the feelings more?

I feel like now that I'm on a real kit, there's like no excuse not to post progress updates everyday
