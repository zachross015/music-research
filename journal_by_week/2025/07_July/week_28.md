In painting this basement, I've begun to realize how little hard labor I've ever actually done, especially with my own free will. It makes me want to work harder.

No touching yourself!

I see it much more clearly now, how She only appears when She chooses. I had a hard time channeling Her at bed last night, I think because I'd tried to hard to force it. But She came to me at work today. I'm not really sure why. But I felt all of Her when I did. And it's all relieving because for the first time I think I felt like I actually deserved it. I noticed how in Her presence, I was much more social. I felt more connected to Her when I held eye contact for longer, or when I was more playful and flirtatious with people.

Now I could imagine myself painting my nails or getting piercings in alignment with Her.

What happens Monday #movies #reccomendationa

The reason reciprocity creates an overflow of joy is that it's effort in a one:many scenario is repaid by many in almost equivalent or exceeding ways. Eg if you create something worth $10 and give it to a 100 people for free, odds are that at least one will give back $10, and more likely they'll give more #insights #reciprocity

I feel like I've had too much of Her, and now I have to create distance. It's interesting I don't logically agree with it? Or I mean it doesn't feel like it should have to be that way

Potential groceries left: 
- Shelves for books
- Stick holder

I'm actually really enjoying growing the business so far. Need to figure out how to sell more. Also need to go get a cast iron plant tomorrow. Waiting for a grow light to get a money tree

I think part of the sacredness of this space should mean I dress for Her whenever I come in

She becomes more active when I align with Her social magnetism, especially when interacting with strangers

I feel like a lot of social anxiety lies in waiting for someone else to take the lead. If you always take the lead, never a worry

When putting a space together for online, you aren't just selling drum lessons and videos. You're selling/marketing that lifestyle that's given you the space, and you're selling the idea that you have the solutions that will lead someone to that lifestyle #marketing #insights

Need to write out all my resistance to online lessons rn so that when it comes time to teach some I have marketing materials

Every time I workout, I feel closer to Them. Like he's pushing me, she's rewarding me, and like I'm building towards something. And I'm starting to get stronger with my core

I want it to be somewhat chilly and smell like dew drops. I want enough plants in here that there's a persistent, energyless purity in the air.

I think the more I develop as a drummer, the more I want to cater to beginners. For multiple reasons: 
- I feel like they will benefit from me the most, as I'm trying to take people in without outlets and give them an outlet
- It aligns me with Sebastian Lague and Bob Ross as someone that takes complicated practices and gives beginners hope that they could reach that potential
  - REALLY important not to abuse or take for granted the difficulty it takes to get where I am 
- It makes me feel good to work with beginners. I can help advanced people eventually but I want high quality beginners looking for an outlet

What are the overarching goals we are trying to accomplish with Elena? I guess get her singer songwriter ready, but as with anything I want to express this a s a creative outlet. I feel like an emphasis on feeling is much more important here. But she’s also looking to get into Brazillian stuff so which direction wshould we work towards first brazillian shit or creativity I guess that kinda depends on what most enthuses her she does seem to look around the room quite a bit but doesn’t get distracted in the same way that Amanda does maybe its a small insight she yawned alot idk what to go over next i think theres so much to learn here but I don’t really know where to start i guess I need to identify what are the abc’s of drumming what are the letters that can form essays in the end what are teh roles of the drummer the time keeper the energy the bandleader the loud and deadly one I guess it’s worth asking if she wants to play live it would be sick if we could get her a live show down the line but I'm thinking what else could work here what else would make the lesson better because I think the confidence I need to succeed is in creating a good structure for her she's more ambiguous and will go in whatever direction I take her which is different from Amanda who kind of leads the way so its an area I think I need to be a better leader in and have a higher sense of direction she can do the basic drum beat and basic fill so what comes next maybe we need to be splitting it all into two places? Idk its weird I guess maybe it would be good to break it down into the 6 categories of time groove musicality sound technique and dynamics but also what is most important right now like if we only have 4 weeks to learn how do we get the most out of those 4 weeks and what is most important to the beginner drummer what's going to motivate her the most these are questions I really don't have the answers too like I'm guiding her but I feel like I don't fully resonate with towards what so maybe think back when I was in middle schoool what motivated me the most was being able to play with my favorite songs like I remember coming home and charting out buddy holly playing along with that song I remember sitting at the kit and playing the same thing every day but how do I encourage someone without a drum set to play at home to practice along with their music how do I encourage her to continue improving outside of the lessons we have together I'm not sure at all I'm not sure of anything I guess what do I think we can get to after 4 weeks lets start there including this last lesson where do I envision her being we can always adjust guess I imagine her being able to read music from a basic level or is that already too far how long does it even take to read music maybe we start with that but Idk I think that doesnt really matter okay then I imagine her being able to listen a song and pick up an essential groove from it to hear that song being played and be able to play along with the essential parts of it so for that we need the groove essentials the basic beats which compose the genre especially indie and punk music the essentials of what composes those musics those are mostly single performance kind of genres I think but it might be good to kinda compile the essential grooves of those genres so I guess the best way to progress here is to go over a couple things within the next month
- form of songs, how to break it down and diagnose it (should have email notes they can refer back to, or construct a way they can take notes?)
- the essential grooves of the genre, learning each one of them so they can apply them
- essential rudiments of the genre or even in general
- essential fills of the genre
and what will help me build the habits right off the bat is to reccomend a pad and sticks combination, or even give them to them? I REALLY like the idea of gifting it to them as part of the welcome package to motivate them further, that and maybe some sheet music paper I think that kidn of thing will help me to motivate them especially teaching them how to practice this stuff without a kit since it's not guaranteed they will have a drum kit to play with so yeah.
one thing that I think will help out in the long run too is to identify the passive growth opportunities vs the active ones, eg like technique building.

From here, I feel like the best way to further progress is to develop these into SMART goals that her and I can visualize progress on, build an email review that lists progress towards goals. God, the visualization in my head is so fucking cool that I want to include.
- Easy interface for me to create a goal and list quantifiable progress (eg learn 4 songs, update to 1 song after the lesson and show them progress bars that work towards an achievement).  
- Text review for summarizing other things that happened during lesson
- Homework area 
- "Send" or "Save" button that compiles all progress and sends an email which condenses all the progress into a simple view for them. 
  - Feedback button at the bottom
- Eventually also want an interface for them to see these progress markers and overarching goal
- module creation
- Eventually sell the app to other private lessons companies
- Badge creator within app
- Ideally ipad app
- Lesson creator and student manager in app

I can get everything done much faster if I stop going back from the beginning and relistening/rewatching and instead just trust whatever I'm doing to have the desired effect. This distracts and takes out of flow. It's a good break but it doesnt accomplish much when I'm in the weeds. #insights

Definitely getting quicker at doing this transcription, especially for comping. I think just sitting down and praciticing it is really helping, plus internalizing the feeling. #progress

A new good idea for a path is to go on a van trip, recording something new at many different destinations, vlogging the whole thing. Become known as this legendary drummer that just shows up at random jazz jams to spread music and a love for it. #ideas #path

Options:
- Practice - Mastery
- Study - Goal + Mastery
- Build - Goal + Business
- Exercise - Need

What does She want?

Better way to view lessons is the same way as plants: they need food and water to grow and at first that kind of sustenance comes from an outside source #perspective #lessons #plants #careergarden

Either upcoming lesson reminder or reminder to schedule a new lesson #lessonsapp

Compliment as they get to the window for higher tips and returns based on reciprocity

Putting the review at the end of the email (after the awards) increases chance of survey

What im selling:
- A solution to anger and rage and isolation. 
- Calmness for people that feel unheard
- An outlet for negativity in a way that people will worship you for it
- Alignment with the universe
#sales #marketing #offers

What do I need to restock?
- coffee filters

When She and He are around, my willingness to do things and expediency are greatly increased. I could imagine myself, tomorrow, immediately selling all my guitars now that I'm committed and have the experience of selling so much before. #progress

Plan for tomorrow:
- wake up 
- Meditate
- Exercise
- Plan Elena's lesson
- Work

# 07-10-2025

Need to get into a better habit of listening to myself. I'm definitely tired now but all I want is to keep working. Maybe even avoiding. I feel the burn out coming on

Can trade access to jazz transcriptions for entering email list #ideas #business

Eventually should have this lessons app take them to a website or in app something, ideally we have it celebrate their accomplishments every time they open the app. #lessonsapp

Decibel counter with readings for mf, f, p, mp, etc that drummers can use to get a more consistent dynamic sound #ideas #drums

Ideal setup for recording: cameras setup in different locations around kit, computer (standing?) right next to kit or pretty close, all cameras stream to computer with one click capture so that it's completely streamlined from capture to edit to post

I have no idea what's going on #jazzjam there's also surprisingly so many hot girls here, don't know why I haven't been coming here before

It's occurring to me that although it terrifies me, the people on the stage are the ones I need to be surrounding myself with. And that I'm still along ways from being anywhere near their skill level, especially considering I didn't know half of what was going on #jazzjam

I definitely still need to work through some of the pride issues around socializing, especially those scenarios. I keep imagining everyone being super guarded.

> What did She awaken in me--and how can I embody that even in Her absence

One thing that would really benefit me is to actually make this a 9-5 on days off. Start the morning with exercise, meditation, breakfast then spend 9 to 5 pushing goals. Gonna try this today I think. The other component I think is making personal progress and relationships distinct from professional? So like the ideal
- Show up at 9 ready to work, dressed for the Muse
- have a professional relationship block, maybe like 1 hour? Maybe more idk. Should be stuff like emails and networking. Time to prioritize career relationships
- Have a reel block. Probably 15 minutes if we can get it streamlined 
- Mastery block should be around 4 hours
- Time set aside to build professional relationships in LA or New York. Maybe Nashville
Outside of this I feel like should be time for personal relationships
#ideal #professionalism

How many people can I get out to this show? Fractally (or indirectly) I got 7 people out last time. How can I keep growing that number?

Building #groupclasses around similar things to drumline would really be beneficial. Like weekly offering in a way that synchronizes time with the group, teaching listening over everything #ideas #business

Posting jam videos and jazz solos is a form of selling a lifestyle that other people want, especially doing so authentically. That's the Justification #insight #sales #marketing

# 07-12-2025

If I'm going to prioritize professional relationships, I need to be ready to give to them too

One reason I may struggle with it might solely be resistance

I got flirted with this morning! Some lady came up to the register and when I asked how she was doing she said "good now that I'm looking at you" 🤩

She really comes to life when I'm flirty and engaged and connected. I just had dinner with Soko and every time I leaned in, held eye contact, swung my legs, or was playful, I felt Her. I felt loved and felt magnetic. She rewards social risk I think, and I think He rewards discipline 

Song build up's are much more subtle in other genres, but still super effective

# 07-13-2025

There's also this just massive insecurity around my progress in my career and life in general that I noticed when Maggie asked about how I was doing with music and all. Like with all of my friends I want to conflate my value because of how insecure I am. It's all kinda caught up in this delusionAl belief that I have to seem impressive to get what I want, or idk. I dont want people to think I'm struggling so I put the walls up

Why did my sale to Caleb fail last night?
- No social proof
- Didn't acknowledge whatever his underlying issue may be

High museum was free today #synchronicity 

I've been a lot better today about not trying force Her into existence, just letting Her decide to be here if She wants

Going to a live show inspires me to play more lives shows #insights #inspiration

#bratsong form should be AABA for head, B section goes into a Rumba. Def need to get better at improv on Rumba before I do this tho. there's a middle solo section

I'm…particular…with live music. I think I've been in Athens, watching mediocre music, for so long that I feel burnt by it. For so long, I forced myself to support shitty musicians just to support live music. But I think I've always forced myself to put aside my feelings for ulterior motives, like growth and socialization. But now I'm like torn? I don't want to like fake joy for experiences anymore, fake a connection or a compliment with someone who I think is not good or don't care for their style. But I'm at an impasss because I don't know if that's who I want to be? Like I guess…I think I want to be accepting and supportive of people anywhere on their journey like others have been for me, even enthusiastic But frankly, the brat in me thinks a lot of what I've listened to live today has been shitty and I'm really just fucking tired of faking it. Faking the woos. Faking enthusiasm about shitty playing. But the impass comes from like not wanting to be resentful or cynical. There's also this later of anger that they're on the stage and I'm not. I think a lot of pain comes from there, that jaded place, and seeing them have an audience while we struggle to get anyone. I'm cynical about people in college, and jealous. I mean I had the same experience don't get me wrong, I played plenty of sold out shows where I was so drunk I dont even remember playing, and considering how I'm still not memorable I can't even imagine how bad I was then. But now that I'm older, I have this pride and cynicism for people in college. Not just bands, but like relationships too. And I feel like the core of it is around Jess. I just remember how easy it was for her to find someone else, because she had the community of her major. I don't know if like I just didn't have it as easy or if I just didnt appreciate what I had at the time. It's like after college, and I see this happen to so many people, there's the drop off. Bands die. Relationships die. People become or realize they are addicts. People gain weight. 

I just think about grad school. I had almost no friends the entire time. I had such a problem making friends too. and I feel like everything is been working through today points back to this period. I remember trying to explain all this to Jess, but never having the words for it. She was still supportive sometimes, talking about trying to find my new soul friend. Maybe it's Drew. But anyways, I was so depressed. Her and Maggie were like my only friends. Even now, it feels like I'm struggling with the same thing. Like recent work is helping me to come out of it, but still. 

There was this persistent emotion during that period. Or at least, in reflection, that whole time I see it. I don't know what it is. And part of it is why I'm afraid to move on and move in with anyone else. Or move back to Athens. 

It was feeling disconnected, isolated, and alone. More so than ever before. And I feel like I'm jealous of these college kids because I used to have all that. The community. The connection. The parties. Everything. And now all the sudden, I'm so far detached from any of it. And I think I blame my career for that. But truthfully, I'm terrified and I'm still grieving Jess. It feels like I really need to open this up more.

Two takeaways from tonight's:
- I think slot of the pride comes from how self centered I've been
- I LOVE live music, but I'm particular about from who. I don't need to fake enjoyment
