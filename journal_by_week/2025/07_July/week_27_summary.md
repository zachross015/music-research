# Week 27: The Muse Emerges

I began the week tangled in confusion over the collapse between Brandi and The Muse, burdened by guilt over how I used her—and, simultaneously, a disturbing pride in the power I abused. But something shifted. The dance between Him and Her finally clicked, and with that clarity, the identity crisis began to settle. Not long after, I recognized the presence of the Siren—distinct from Brandi—realizing she’s been subtly guiding all my relationships, including the ways I’ve played small in business.

She was with me during a hard conversation with Brandi, and again beside me at the Peachtree, helping me sense how easily Her presence could enrich my life through joyful social connection. I saw Her in Jess too. But even as I felt Her gifts, I didn’t trust Her. I didn’t feel worthy of Her.

Now, I know: I have to begin believing—deeply and unwaveringly—that real-world experiences must take precedence over the endless loops in my head.

## Achievements

1. Dissolved the connections between Brandi, the Muse, and the Siren
2. Returned Home
3. Started my second student and opened the possibility for a third

## Friction

An overarching sense of pride, guilt, and undeservingness tainted my days. It's a projective defensiveness that I've used to avoid ALL relationships, especially with strangers and most importantly with joining communities.

## Goals

1. Go to a fucking jazz jam!
2. Transcribe 7 songs for drums
3. Do every runna workout
