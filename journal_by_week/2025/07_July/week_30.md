I feel like I need to talk right now. I don't know if there's anything wrong. I think I just don't have any energy because of my run yesterday and today is an off day for me and I decide to take as a rest day and it's hard to get the energy to do things that are fulfilling. You know I went to the pool, which is a big thing but that's pretty much all I did I mean I worked out. I just have no motivation and I mean like it's a good thing cause that's what today's kind of for us to crash but I guess I wanna be dealing with some other emotional issues like the fucking Gym trainer and Amy and I mean like those are just specific instances like there's two root problems I really want to be addressing and that is the fat identity that's become more and more clear to me and trying to figure out how to be strong and still mindful in those two issues are Well. The first issue like I feel like I know how to work on it more. I'm just at a loss of energy and the second issue. I don't really know how to deal with and it's really difficult to even want to like stand up for myself or have the self-respect and the strength and the courage to Have higher standards not for myself or not just for myself, but for other people too and really push them to it. It's like I'm in so low energy right now that I just I can't deal with any of it and I'm not gonna make myself try to. I just wanted to say something

Resistant to anything that could possibly influence or control someone else's decision as if I don't wanna take responsibility for them in any way shape or form. Like I don't wanna tell someone I've been meaning to talk to them because I don't wanna force them into conversation. 

How do I believe in myself more? 

I have a stupid amount of energy today, most likely from my run yesterday and caffeine

Planning one lesson out will make homework so much easier #lessons really, having a continuous plan will always make it so much easier

Researching benefits of music will make it easier to get people to play more #musicrunna

The big challenge of this period is going to be Parisian

Need to, from the beginning, be capturing analytics on progress. Possibly get Drew on as a content writer? And where does the money come in? Is it monthly subscription, or pay for more time like Duolingo? I think the only problem with Duolingo model is that there's no way for us to challenge people and verify results that way. BUT an offshoot music theory app would be REALLY good under the duolingo model. #musicrunna

Practices should all be easily recordable. #musicrunna

Runna uses a goal oriented system, pick a goal and it structures everything up until that goal. What does that look like for drums? What goals end goals are there?

I radiate a WHOLE different energy when I'm well exercised. I'm funnier, happier, more joyful, and magnetic effortlessly. #evidence #exercise

I feel weird right now. A weird mix of peace and lethargy and stress. They somehow coexist. Not really joy. Just anxiety. I wanna eat like shit but I'm trying not to.

Next jazz video should center around getting the speed to do Parisian. Make it an actual goal to do this. Have a lot of failure leading up to it, start strong, follow hero's journey. #ideas #videos

I think the hard part of studying jazz or music is there's no like direct answers. It's hard to analyze because I still don't really know what questions to ask outside of just learning the language 

Why was I so eager to leave that conversation with Jennifer? I didn't even talk to the other person. She got me in for an appointment but I at least established that I can't afford the program

You can't force Her or Him into the present. All you can do it listen for Them and prepare for their presence. #insight

Main issue with #meditation right now is not being able to tell what the main issue is. External distractions no longer impact me much but I get lost in thought constantly. I think it's subtle dullness but I really just need to sit and understand it

Onboarding people for general improvement, in any instrument, should just seek to improve ALL technique with daily practices that focus on individual parts. Let drilling into a single concept advance with mastery ie for a guitar student, one day on alternate picking, one on slides, one on chords, etc. For drums, one day on technique, one day on timing, one day on dynamics, etc or alternatively for each sub area (eg technique one day for accents, one for diddles, one for sticking, etc) #musicrunna this is akin to what I did with both working out and the 15 minute a day book, except that book was fixed and this is much more dynamic to the weaknesses of the player

Maybe the way that goal setting works is it tries to create the shortest route? Like if the goal is to get better at uptempo jazz swing, itll take the end goal and end date and customize a routine which should (ideally) guarantee it gets there by customizing practices up until then with a mixture of endurance/sprints #musicrunna

The set up for the today view should eventually become the workout page #musicrunna

Something that's been coming up a lot in my head. Today was how reactive my dad was when it came to confrontation. It was never something that was used for mutual betterment. It was always reactive and the sense that he only ever did it when he was angry. where is my mom always confrontational about everything in a much healthier way the specific scenario that keeps coming up in my mind was the time that my dad busted in and yelled at me for the pee, buckets and threaten to take my drum set away, and it comes up a lot because I think it was a really traumatic experience. I think it came up because my dad said something today about cleaning up the sesame seeds and so now I think whenever it comes to strength and confrontation that's what comes up in my mind that I'm either only doing it reactively or I have to do it reactively and it's always out of anger not really out of like mutual respect

Masturbating silences Her voice #insights

Beginning to realize the importance of studying music for impact. Studying jazz is opening up this like world of scenery I've never noticed before, most importantly how the little things are what change the impactfulness. Studying how they increase intensity, create tension, release it, etc seems so fucking important. I started noticing this in Deltarune where Toby Fox masterfully increases the intensity of the main theme throughout the game, not only that but the different renditions of different themes are so loaded with emotions that it makes me fall in love with the game. #studyingjazz

What did I learn from discover strength today?
- Initiation that went over goal setting was a really good way of easing into the session
  - Could re-instating goals help with my own sales?
- Emphasis on research increased my trust for them
- The 2 free sessions really helped me get involved
- Locking in a social customer (eg me) is good for their marketing

And in general:
- Just mentioning I teach drum lessons perks people who want lessons up (eg Momo talked about it). I need to focus on these people and really sell it to them. Give them a free lesson (with onboarding) then try and get them locked in with everything else. Part of this means I REALLY FUCKING NEED SOCIAL PROOF AND AN ORGANIZED OFFER AND A WAY TO CONGLOMERATE ALL OF IT TOGETHER

Becoming more aligned means constantly approaching my life with intention. Getting into the habit of looking at my goals and asking, with every decision, whether or not they align with those, and cutting out anything and everything that doesn't. Giving more weight to my goals so they aren't just something I put up and forget about. Approaching every practice re-aligning and respecting my own boundaries more than any one. #insight

A lot of selling is having the solutions to their problems before they even think about it. Coming up with those solutions is a matter of repeated experience every time someone has a problem. Like every time I make a sale, write out why it didn't work then find a solution, like I'm doing for Caleb

I think I'm afraid of other peoples anger because of the way my dad always handled his 

Sell like you don't have any other option. I think this gym company was brought into my life to show me how to do this

All this pride and defensiveness is somehow coming out because of the sales stuff

Eating and masturbating unintentionally. I need 2 days off.

The big thing in playing with others is you have to get good enough, technique wise, to not think at all about your part. Much like the rest of the world, it's about being generous and considerate of others while you play and allowing the universe to take care of you while you take care of them #studyingjazz #music

My appreciation for jazz is deepening. I'm playing along to Delilah, I'm starting to sense the ebb and flow of musical conversations. Seeing how the drummer is instantly picking up on changes to what the pianist or lead player are doing, how the groove harmony is being modified instantly to match. It's so fucking cool, gives me a much deeper appreciation for what's happening #jazz #music #studyingjazz

Practice records are making it obvious how much practice mastery takes, and that I want to do even more

Need a break and lots of protein

Why do I get so defensive when the topic of my career and art come up with my mom? Like she wants to be creative and some sort of me wants to put her down for it or is cynical about it. I know it's not just this conversation, I'm really like resistant about anything with my parents

What are the commonalities between
- Not smiling as a auto-rejection mechanism
	- Persistent stress connected 
- Fears of selling
- Weight issues with Blobert
- fears of anger leaking during confrontation 
- Fear of surrounding myself with better people
- Failure to make simple business progresses (eg reviews and ratings, asking others for rating)

- Learned behavior from dad
- Auto rejection mechanisms ie ways of either rejecting others or rejecting myself until I'm "good enough"
- Mountains of resistance against success, in relationships as well as business

I did something good and hard today. Kevin wanted to go hang out and hike, but I realized it wasn't part of my goals this week so I decided not to. That's the dedication I want! Part of cutting out unnecessary things

A good goal after I get used to building exercise pattern for people is to get to a point where I input a target for an exercise and the plan auto populates with associated exercises #musicrunna

Morning opens can be so much more efficient if u listen to audiobooks #ideas

Need to come up with practice methods that don't necessarily require a kit or pads so that any student doesn't have an excuse #lessons

The #musicgym would solve the problem of people not having equipment at home #lessons allowing anyone to learn and improve music. Doesn't necessarily need to be large, start with a small venue and build up

Lighting the drum set to feel performance ready would be amazing for lessons and my own diligence, making it central and beautiful.

Definitely need a community tab aspect. Need a way to use this to motivate myself and my friends #musicrunna

On the practice screen, bottom should have a pause/end workout flow. Eventually the "next exercise" button can be included to auto start the next one's timer/met, especially if there's a full screen met this would be good for jumping between exercises after a planned routine. Next should be the summary screen where private notes can go. Main page should have a routine history #musicrunna what of this is absolutely essential for this version? What can be saved?

Pitch grader #musicrunna

If things with Elena doesn't work out it's not entirely because I'm not experienced, it can also be because what I offer is not for her

Especially with a routine builder, can monetize creators seamlessly through a practice routine marketplace #musicrunna

Friction for the month all revolved around inherited insecurities that, in my mind, stand between my connecting with others. This, as well as starting the month without realistic intentions and having unrealistic goals for my time made it impossible to reach most of what I strived for. A lot of this comes from (1) not approaching months with any ideas rooted in reality (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just means since it still pushes me) and (2) not re-evaluating this goal when planning each week.
