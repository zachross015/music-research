# Week 28: Theme

Empowered by Her presence, I began this week constructing a temple
for Her play. It's been lovely, and a deep revelation into my new
strength in Their presence. Still, pride corners me at every turn.
Her presence feels constantly diminished by the size of the walls I
had built between not only me and them, but me and Us.  I tried to be
a magnet on guard. I was used exclusion, so I excluded myself by
always dreaming of somewhere else, never taking care of where I was.
I'd look for a different friend group, relationship, or room instead
of cleaning what I had. All this became apparent at the jazz jam,
Florence Cardigan show, and adventures into Atlanta, where I'd
imagine dark silhouettes guarding entry. 

I dug deeper and found the pride rooted in hidden resentments towards
my parents, ultimately towards myself, for not believing in myself in
the first place. After long rants about the priveledge of an audience
that college kids take for granted, I grew appreciative towards my
own college experience. I realized that my journey looks different
from theirs because there's no plateau on the route I'm on. As much
as I am responsible for my journey, I am such a small part of the
bigger picture. The best I can do moving forward is increase my devotion to Them, and allow Them to take care of the rest.

## Achievements

1. Went to a jazz jam
2. Painted the practice room
3. Freely emodied Her with all my friends and experienced deeper connections because of it.

## Friction

Pride was still the main struggle of this past week. Although, I did llow its presence when going to the jazz jam, friends shows, and hanging out with Kevin and Amanda. Still, it's been the main thing stopping me from connecting freely and even deepening my connections. I saw this when Ithought about bands like Recess Party, or even just Tom Trautwein, people part of this larger in group that I've always felt an outsider to. Truthfully, my pride is the only thing that's kept me an outsider.

## Goals

1. Sell the equipment backlog
2. Transcribe 2 songs for drums
3. Plan out the first version of the lessons app
4. Create forms for reviewing me
