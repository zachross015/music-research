Emrah Koten #reccomendations #drummers

Intentions today: 
- embody Her around Glenn
- Calm
- Sell when I can, but with humility

I need to figure out these fucking weight issues, they're driving me absolutely insane. Even cursory look at it I know there's a lot of resistance to slenderness because of like stories I tell myself about being a skinny person. And there's also more than likely some kind of guard around how being slender contributes to the next phase of my life. But the diet issues drive me insane

PRIORITIZE. Email list first. Build the app when this works and feels good: as an extension of an existing system. Email should eventually invite them into the app. But getting this end of it to FEEL good is going to require more diligent dreaming and planning than just gettinf ChatGPT to build out the app. It's doing a great job at the infrastructure, but this is going to need more than just a good infrastructure #musicrunna

Log pauses and stops as "Laps" or alternatively option for next exercise #musicrunna

I feel like music theory should easily become a next option #musicrunna like why isn't there already a Duolingo for music?

Onboarding for #musicrunna should just check if they have a kit or a single pad

For once, I wasn't drawn to Brandi and her dramas. I wanted nothing to do with it and distanced myself like I would from McKenzie #progress and I think it's all thanks to Her

Plan:
- Play around with ideas in figma
- Exercise
- Meditate
- Practice

Even a basic start to the coaching app would be good. Daily practices served right to someone's phone on a schedule. Can start out with just broadcasting what I'm working on. Integrates well with the metronome app #musicrunna

Personalization magnifies reciprocity apparently #insights #marketing can incorporate this into #musicrunna by having initial setup customize things like working days and other things

My biggest fear with reciprocity is like forcing someone into something with reservations. Like goading it from a standpoint of obligation rather than genuine care or removing their autonomy

Gregory's constant call outs is something I take personally since I was the one who taught him and I feel like I failed to demonstrate respectable treatment of other employees

The way to cultivate an obsession is not to focus on a single remedy (ie practicing constantly) but instead to create MULTIPLE outlets that all serve the same higher purpose under different contexts and energy levels. Like transcribing is good for low energy, writing is good for creative, watching and journaling is also good for low energy. Not just the performance, the look of it too.

When I over drank caffeine today (18g instead of 15g) without exercise or breakfast, I ate an excessive amount of sugar later in the day and felt little control over this #insights

Like the thought of Glenn including me in his life is loaded. It's really the first person I know who went to school for music and has demonstrated the same level of commitment I have to the craft. It feels like a real professional entering my life and a whole new standard to strive for

# 07-17-2025

I think down the line, I need to do the ONE dumps into a single focused solution. This will make the next practice super simple, so maybe do a client facing summary but then a full list of everything I notice. But I think part of holding them to a higher standard also means putting pressure on things like outside practice. One simple way to do this is to start by making them get pads and sticks as a base level assumption #teaching

I think in #teaching, get a couple grooves down and THEN start teaching about listening for them in music to learn from others

What is is I want right now with #musicrunna for #teaching?
- Give a "General" idea for homework, list of exercises and suggested amount of work days and times, especially with single day activities
- Allow the student to customize their schedule
- Self-optimization
- Simple interface for creating exercises, achievements
- Automated metronome for going through exercises, create less friction in dilligent practices (automated rest timers)
The thing I want THE MOST right now is to be able to text them a link to a lesson summary/homework breakdown that's essentially a single web page talking about all this information. FUck the email, there's not nearly enough customization there. I want to be able to use this platform to customize my own routines as much as anyone else's

Also, if I can get this up and running, sending something like a weekly practice reccomendation to someone like Caleb would be super good.

What is the MVP?

Reading through and writing out my lessons notes, it's obvious to me that one of the big limitations I'm facing right now is that I don't extend to my students any like consistent system or agreement for homework and summaries. I REALLY need to get this figured out.

Small improvements 
- Text reminder for lessons
- Summary email

Different drummers' methods for developing a better sense of comping, grooving, and feeling during solos.

[Benny Greb](www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XI2aHSBTnU). Mean what you play. Learning to become aware of what you play by approaching it in the form of communication. The best thing you can do for all of them is set a clear frame of rules and see what you can do within this frame.
- 2-bar improv: play whatever you want for the first bar, then repeat it for the second.
- 4-bar improv: double it
- Note-value improv: Pick a subdivision and only play in it
- Orchestration improv: Pick one instrument and see how creative you can get with it

I know that my issue is that my pocket diminishes greatly during improv, possibly due to unawareness.

[Larnell Lewis]() Isolate a limb, keep pocket with the other three and improv with the fourth. Can be interlaced with Benny Greb.

Why did conversation with Brandi open back up the super communicator stuff I haven't thought about in weeks?

#ideas #musicrunna contact books for use of exercises in app 

#ideas #practiceefficiency what if it's a 3 week timeline? One week transcribe, one week learn, one week polish and record? Could use the learning week to understand my weaknesses much better, especially speed wise. I really wish I had cameras to understand my flaws. Especially one above

This practice room....it's so beautiful. It's become my safe haven. When the world out here is so chaotic, I feel like I enter the room and a calm comes over. No one can hurt me in there. It's a sacred space.

I really only want Brandi around for comfort during drama. Amy is trying to start shit again and I almost flocked to her

I really don't wanna deal with Brandi's grief. Can't tell if it's insensitive or if she makes it a problem

Higher standards unites people, lower standards distances them. How can I preserve the joy while having the high standards? How can I invite others to join? It doesn't have to be aggressive to be inspiring. All an Artist can do for another Artist is inspire

Becoming the best means learning from EVERYONE, even the ones I don't like. It'll be worthwhile, even if they are conflated bags of garbage (specifically thinking of a certain drummer here) to read all their books and immerse myself completely.

Why am I so drawn to the Mousticus stuff right now? I just desperately want to be stepped on and used. Everything with Amy and this fitness instructor is making me feel like a slave to circumstances and influence. My mind is highlighting not only the ways that my life is easily influenced but the stark difference between positive influence by invitation and what feels like manipulation. Like this gym instructor is so fucking hot that I'll do anything she says and I'm terrified she'll call me a pussy if I don't or call me weak or think less of me so I'm trying to exit gracefully in a way that preserves my dignity but these people are fucking vultures. But even then, I still want her to fucking take me for her own pleasure. Use me as her sex toy and shove me in her shoes during the day. She has that sadistic appeal, that look in her eye that parallels my exs. She seems mentally fucking strong and all I want in is a piece of whatever she is. I'm so fucking intimidated by her in a horny way and I recognize this coming from Pleasure but it's blotting out Her and the amount of resistance it's taking not to just masturbate to her is driving me crazy and it's like I don't know how to recenter this energy back on Her.

Need like a defined lower bound structure for growth at this point that keeps me in this state of mind

Amy trying to come into my life again is a nice reminder of the #progress I've made in my relationships. Most the people I surround myself with now are drama-free and more energizing, or at least the drama doesn't have the depth to corrupt me or hurt me in the way that hers used to

Should find a condensed way to show the metronome and exercise on the same screen. For most exercises, the net doesn't need to take up the full screen #musicriunna

In just so tired today. I need fucking break from it all. But I also need to do like mental health work and exercise and fuck me all I wanna do is drum. But I need to become much more intentional with practicing the weakest parts

I need to become the best FOR THEM. For the audience. Every show makes someone's night. I remember shows from When I was a kid, and I have the power to bring that to other people, but only if I hold people to the same standards as what I see. This is why I can't tolerate bullshit anymore.

It's like I see that with new people, or even some people I'm closer to now, these higher standards are something I can become immediately and be accepted for it. But with older friends like Amy or even JJ, I think it's going to drive a further wedge

Plan
- Coffee & Breakfast & Systems
- New shoes
- Run 
- Dog park
- Cleaning devotion
- Review

Sometimes it feels like I have to be mopey around people like family because I've been that way for so long even when it's not who I want to be

Most of the good #sales experiences I've noticed recently focus on the experience and benefits without the price. Place I just went to buy running shoes didn't even advertise the price until I either asked or purchased #sales

Eventually use #musicrunna as a research tool give discount to dummies like various finger training and stuff

What does total immersion look like and how can I enter it without burning out? Is burning out an actual threat or is it just resistance?

Back in high school I had this coach who for the longest time of villainized you know he actually genuinely. I think it was a dick but the more I look back on it the more I see that everyone at my high school had a more aggressive and pressuring teaching style. For the longest time, I believed that it was abuse and it wasn't right as now I look back on it and the way I see is that they believed in me more than anyone ever had before you know, they pushed me to my limits because they saw something not just me but everyone around me And there are things in there that I still have to work through, but I think the sentiment of it is something that I wished I could've made for myself, and I still wish I can to have that level of love for something and belief in something that you know they surround you with that they push you farther than you think you're capable of going they know how to break through barriersand turn you into the best version of yourself and it's like I want to reconcile with them and have gratitude for the fact that I am the person I am now because of them the good and the bad. I push myself to my own limits and have because they believed in me and I think ever since then I've struggled to find people who do the same thing and believe in me in that way and I think that's why college didn't work in like grad school didn't work because I didn't believe myself not in the way that they believed in me and my team. And it feels like I'm hitting that point in my growth where I recognize what it takes to be a better sales person a better drummer, a better builder you know just better and it's that belief that love that pursuit of mastery that I'm only starting to connect with again that I think I detach from because of the trauma. And now I'm grateful for them you know for pushing me in ways that my parents didn't even know how to push me for having that ability to see weakness clearly, and to eradicate it and to boost our strengths and the focus on the bigger picture, no matter how much it hurt us.

A good thing for #practiceefficiency is to indicate what and why I'm going to practice something. That's how to approach with intention

Priorities for the rest of the day:
- Planning
- Cleaning
Tomorrow:
- Emotional recovery
