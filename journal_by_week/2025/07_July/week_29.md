#app similar to Runna, but step by step walks people through drum mastery by providing different learning routes and daily exercises

I feel like a lot of the #pride came from my growing role in leadership and defensiveness around that

My recent fantasies are just as telling as any Previous ones. right now they're all playing out as: being in a bad mood and wanting Her to comfort/save me. She comes and talks to me while being horny enough to kiss me. I ask Her to wear me around, She agrees but first She wants to have sex with me. I think I'm finding pleasure in being a victim, woe is me as always, but at least in this scenario it's consensual and I'm taller. #progress

I think I always need to focus on growing the side hustle that's working. Like focus on the long term with honing my skills, but allowing whatever is attracting people and building sustainable income to take the limelight. Like I can practice all I want, but allowing lessons to be my greatest strength while I build everything else up is just as important.

Gaining much more confidence and comfort in teaching, especially from the plans I've built #progress

Once I get this app to a stable state, it should be worth testing with other friends teaching lessons

Getting better at transcribing is going to be a really good skill in the long run for both passive income and learning other people's parts. Should ideally have a cover page that details the emotional style, or a brief like poem describing what it makes me feel like #ideas #drums #growth

Part of the #pride comes from feeling like I'm not only responsible for but directly in control of everyones futures around me, so when I'm not reaching the goals which help the entire populatiom (eg bringing 5 people instead od 100 to a friends show) I'm letting down everyone involved, even when they're not even expecting me to bring anyone at all. I've inflated my value and purpose, taking the lions share of the blame without the lions share of the profits and centralized myself as being the most important person in every room, not being a team player as a leader

I really want to surround myself with people with higher standards

Always trying to find a way to talk about what I do and sell it #pride is it pride or is it just real? It feels forced

Had a long dream last night, but the only part I remembered was telling him I only made $25,000 a year right now and him getting excessively worried about me. He offered, with great pressure, to supplement my income. I refused and told him it's something I need to figure out on my own.
