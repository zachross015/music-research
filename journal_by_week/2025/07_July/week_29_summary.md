# Week 29: Theme

This week has been about discipline and dilligence. I started the week meeting up with Glenn, a friend from pre-college. He detailed his time spent practicing 3 hours a day even before classes started. At the same time, I began watching the Bear. All of these forces ruminated in me throughout the week, reminding me of the discipline required for mastery. I practiced. I practiced hard. For several days, I spent over 3 hours in the practice room, and even used downtime for casual practices. 

The combination of seeing this friend and watching The Bear has ignited in me a drive I haven't felt since high school. I pressure to succeed that parallels what I experienced with Matt Howell and Garofalo. Where I'd previously seen them as traumatic figures, I now recognize the potential they saw in me, the love they had for the craft, and the abilities they posessed to bring the best out of those they taught. I also saw how much they believed. A feeling I'm still learning to cultivate. Seeing this made me look around at my life, noticing the distractions that would pop up. Amy texted again. The fitness instructor goading for my time. All of the outside competitions which I felt I needed to fight against for my own attention. Learning to have zero tolerance for these and any other detriments to my practice is my main focus. Even with these stresses, escaping to the dilligence of the temple They have built has given me a new appreciation for the sacredness of this space, something that I'm hoping to further refine as a portal outside of this world.

## Achievements

1. Met up with Glenn and organized a meetup with Jacob
2. 10 hours of practice time
3. Ran all of Indian Seats 

## Friction

Competing with external distractions from loose ends was my main struggle. That and weight issues. The weight issues I now understand are from (1) a lack of dilligence to my management habits and (2) Fat Blobert, the obese identity. Other issues are:
- Haven't said no to the fitness instructor yet
- Decided not to confront Amy BUT also didn't say anything to her
- Haven't sold the equipment backlog. Partially because I want to create as much value and know that lighting/marketing is going to play a big part, but that also feels like an excuse
- Only transcribed one song
- Haven't created forms
- Connection with Brandi only becomes important in distress
- Need systems in place to ensure dilligence and to sustain it
- Need to start using gained intelligence to approach practice with much more intention

Main reason for alot of these is similar to the reason I don't have a good structure: lack of physical text I guess that I renew intentions with every day, so goals have fallen off the wayside. Structure is getting much nicer but need zero tolerance for distractions and to believe in myself more and be willing to be stronger/more particular in ways that I haven't yet and haven't figured out why yet

## Goals

1. Sell equipment backlog
2. Finish designing MVP for Lessons app
3. Transcribe 1 song, Learn 1 song, and Master 1 song
