# Week 30: Theme

The week began in a slump. In spite of my renewed intentions and methods for achieving goals, I had felt emotionally conflicted over Amy texting me and an internal strife over starting a fitness class that I wanted but couldn't afford. Both of these, along with growing weight insecurities, were threatening the inspiration and peace I had been given. They opened a wound. A deep root of actions which I now realized mirrored the habits my dad. Everything from weight issues to my resting level of stress to my ability to stand up for myself was a branch of this seed. And it exhausted me. Each day, I asked myself "why am I so stressed?" And up until reviewing today, the resolution has been rooted in these insecurities, but truthfully I believe it's because I did not start last week feeling I'd rested enough. Even today, I still feel drained.

In parallel, I struggled to meet the goals I set for myself. Not out of dilligence, but out of resistance and emotional withdrawl. I didn't sell my guitars because I hadn't realized the attachment I'd built with them, surviving many breakups and deaths. I didn't finish transcribing a song. The Lessons App I had been focusing on went through several different iterations of thought, finally settling on a much simpler app while revealing the feature creep that plagued every app I'd built before.

In spite of my struggles, this was a productive week. The app has a design for version 0.1 that I'm happy with and would use. Many hours were spent studying jazz and I felt rewarded for it. I attended the free fitness class and asserted my financial boundary. I ran ALOT. And the best part, each day was started off with intention, each practice with intention, and each run with intention. This alone was the crowning achievement of my week that has made the difference between feeling on an off the rails. Even in His and Her absence, I remained dilligent and felt proud of myself for it. I leave this week feeling uneasy about the shadow that's been dug up by my weight issues and everything else connected to the thorn that mirror's my dad, yet excited in how the strength of constant intent is aiding my growth.

## Achievements

1. Listed all of the equipment backlog (except guitars) on Ebay
2. Finished MVP design for practice app
3. Learned 1 song, "mastered" one song
4. Approached everything with intention

## Friction

The parts of my goals that didn't quite line up this week were mainly time restricted. I did a lot of cutting away during this period and I think things really need to stay that way.
- Didn't finish transcribing Daahoud mainly out of priority
- Weight issues were prevalent over entirety of week and only dealt with them today
- The issues with Amy, not responding to Jacob, and the fitness instructor loomed over my mind the entire week which caused more stress than I thought it would. In every instance, needing closure seems important
- Even when Momo expressed interest in drum lessons, I've felt much resistance to selling to her (in the same way I felt with Elena)
  - Likely from "needing" to succeed here
- Weight issues, confrontation issues, money issues, anger issues (especially in asking for help), resting bitch face, persistent stress, sales issues, and the ability to surround myself with people better than me are all behaviors mirrored from my family
- Didn't sell guitars due to emotional distress

## Goals

1. Discover and alleviate secret pleasures of being fat
2. Find 1 new student 
3. Transcribe 1 comping songs
