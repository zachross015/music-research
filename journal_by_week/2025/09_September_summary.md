# September

This month was one of social, business, and exercise development.  I ran up to
my first 14k, reached out to and had dinner with Michael Kralick, met up with
Jesse Mangum at an Isra show, officiated a wedding, started an LLC, and had
numerous social encounters resulting from naturally attracting people as my
highest self. 

The drawback of all this progress was a lack of concrete progress in the things
bringing me joy: drums and meditation. I struggled, and am still struggling,
with this alot, worrying that the growth in other areas of my life are taking
too much priority over what I see to be defining traits of my life--solid
foundations which make all else possible. Within this realization, I have
worked with many things to avoid (a word I use intentionally) the pain of my
lacking. In order to compensate for these defects, I tried harder and harder to
force myself deeper into dilligence, with the only outcome being burnout and
dopamine addiction. The Charlie Kirk assassination only exacerbated these
issues, forcing me into a video game hole and numbness. I struggled deeply with
this numbness. I worried about its permanence and, especially after two or so
weeks of bliss, felt discouraged by how little I wanted to be social or grow in
any endeavor. 

I approached this pain differently this time though. I took a break. In this
break, I made my LLC. I got onto a good sleep schedule. I exercised more and
found my way back to the breath. And this past weekend, I had a great jam
session with Spare Change. 

I've continued the break into today, largely because I have yet to define a new
future I'd enjoy living up to.

## Friction

- Exercising, including drumming, within two hours of bed time kills sleep
- Burnout from (1) scheduling way too much social events within a week (4 late nights with 4 opens) and (2) worrying about drumming motivation when I wasn't inspired to practice and was instead inspired to grow the business, ie focus was not on drumming and instead of practicing, got worked up about where my attention was instead of following inspiration
- Spread myself even more thin to try and alleviate the pain of burnout
- Didn't start planning out concrete objectives until end of month
- Analytic obsession
- Too much fretting over offer specifics. It needs to be done by now

## Goals for next month

1. Edit and post video
2. Get 5 students (Finish Website + Get fliers from Aidan)
3. Learn 2 Frankie Dunlop songs
