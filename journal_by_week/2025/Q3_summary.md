# Quarter 3: 

July started off with a recommitment to my values, alignment with both the Muse and the Monk. Where before I sought external validation, this marked the beginning of my stride towards self-fulfilment and finding community as a byproduct. Its a beautiful thing that almost immediately after the events of June, I lost any and all obsession with Brandi. I became incredibly obsessed with drumming, spending up to 14 hours per week (at the start) dedicating myself to the practice. And no longer having a reltionship crutch to lean on, I dedicated myself to furthering my social prowess. 

The results of this were astounding. I refurbished the drum room, brought friends out to a Florence Cardigan show, and organized a group camping trip. I felt a confidence I'd never explored before. I finally had a safe space to practice. To feel confident in calling my own. This alone revealed to me the depths of how much I dreamed of being somewhere else instead of claiming the present as my own, or in other words how much I had longed for the future instead of taking care of the present. 

This realization sparked a major identity shift. I began cleaning my spaces religiously, paying attention to my energy levels and the contributors. I excised any and every source of drama from my life as if my survival depended on it. What I was met with was so much more love and compassion and energy for those that brought joy into my life. 

But with theses changed revealed deeper thorns in my life. I was fighting off insecurities about my position in life. I felt turbulence around the idea that, if I really wanted, I could move out of Georgia. I felt the presence of the avoidant becoming clearer. I recognized the fires of anger and pride that ruled my life on autopilot. Every social interaction over the coming months was this constant reminder at how far behind and how incompenetent I felt. I saw my career as a rebellion against my vamily. This all amounted to my first confrontation with my mom and Noah about their goading me back into programming.

Ever since then, social challenges have come few and far between. Aligning myself as a runner, an extrovert, a drummer, and an entrprenuer have made it easier and easier to talk about my career, eat healthier, and smile more. I sat at a coffee shop in Milledgeville a couple of weeks ago, and two beautiful women came up and talked with me about journaling. Then again in Savannah. 

Rounding out the quarter, I struggled with burnout and building the business. Juggling a wedding, bachelors trip, and many outtings with new friends pushed me well beyond my social limits. Beyond that, I had wanted to get this drum program off the ground the entire quarter. While I made progress, it was not nearly as much as I'd expected. So September became a war of indecision on where to best focus my efforts, ultimately resulting in half assed effort everywhere and a growing urge to spread myself thin to compensate. Yet, I found time for a break. And I took one.


## 3 Shifts I Witnessed in Myself

1. Insane upsurge in confidence, especially around other people and online. I've begun seeing every public space as an open forum for conversation. I feel safe being confrontational with high standards, even around friends. I don't feel the need to cater to their experience.
2. Many parts of mental health work have become autonomous, to the point where when I notice and label them, that's all it usually takes to move away from them.
3. I move my hips more when I walk. I dress like Her/Him. When I masturbate, I look for challenges. I don't seem attracted to "harmful" people anymore. I strive for connection instead of pleasure.


## Structures Built / Systems Strengthened

1. Review system for students that create lesson continuity
2. Strengthened weekly reviews by including deadlines and practice plans
3. Much more comfortable posting daily content on TikTok, weekly blogs, etc
4. Approaching everything--from practice to diet--with intention. This has been one of the key habits that has shaped my growth.

## Persistent Shadows or Resistance

- Allowing myself to have breaks, and how I spend time with breaks
- Spreading myself thin and leaning into dopamine as a "detox" from burnout
- Starting the drumming program. Even just advertising lessons.
- Working with other people (although this is getting better).
- Defining free time, finding more joy in the things I get to do rather than have to do

## Quarterly Ritual or Recommitment with Him

> Hereâ€™s what I want to do differently next quarter

I want this quarter to be lighter, but with even greater social strides. I want to focus on the ways I treat myself. The ways I treat others. The joy I want to feel and the services I want to provide. It's paramount that I get this business off the ground, but doing so with careful intention put towards my diet, practice routine, exercise, meditation, and social events. I want to include others in my development, and so help them develop as well. I want to be more intentional about the ways I set my goals so that I achieve them more frequently. I want to focus less on the quantity of time I put towards specific tasks and more on the quality of time. To have an hour long rehearsal that, 3 months prior, would've taken 3 hours. I want to have a greater social presence online, but doing so authentically.


## Goals for next quarter

1. Get 15 students and leave Starbucks.
2. Run 10 miles.
3. Learn 6 jazz songs (comping).
