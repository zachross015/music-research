# August

The crux of this month was around social growth and dealing with avoidance, with the depths of avoidance showing up in my career, my weight, and my habits. I started the month in New York for Evan's bachelor trip. The entire trip was a wonderful adventure, surrounded by lots of love and an accepting group which made it easy to take risks. During this trip, I found a new side to myself. I flirted with a girl. I saught rejection at a Mets game. I let go of financial insecurities and learned to live presently fo the experience. I fell in love with New York.

Coming back from there was a wake up call. I was moving too slowly, and if I so desired there were opportunities to survive a move out of Georgia. Still, I didn't feel confident with myself. I became sick, which lasted into the next week. I was also fighting off the insecurities that I felt with my position in life. I wasn't validating myself in the ways I needed, and traced the root of this issue back to the avoidant. I saw my career as yet another way I wanted to rebel against my family, pushing it as far as I could as a big "fuck you" to my parents, whose presence was bringing out great shame with in. I couldn't handle their joy. I wouldn't believe their enthusiasm. I projected great pain on my dad's weight. All of these weighed on me throughout the week. Until I finally began uncovering the source of the avoidant: the way that dad used to reject us. Even just opening my eyes to this source created a new found confidence.

So I started taking risks. I exploited a financial arbitrage opportunity I'd been mulling over. I agreed to a musical role for Jacob. I rejected a band that wasn't going to pay me over $200 to play. All of these were small little ways of accepting the presence of these avoidance tendencies, and moving forward in spite of them. But like a vine, I began uncovering more and more places the avoidant plagued me. I dug deeper and deeper until I had an emotional breakthrough in the form of a poem I'd written at Ponce. It spoke everything I felt about the avoidant, all the pleasures and the pains. After doing so, I finally understood it.

This realization led to a conflict with my family, the first where I spoke up about something that had pained me for a long time: the gentle push to get back into programming. It was messy. But it was good. And I hope to see many more of these soon, to a lesser degree.

Aside from all of this, this month was my most dilligent yet. I rounded off an average 2 hours of practice time. I made $150 in gig/lessons money. I sold 3 items. I, with the exception of the last week, exercised more than I had in over a year. The biggest priority was prioritizing my health better, and I saw so much improvement in my motivation, my focus, and my dilligence from this change alone. It makes me fall in love with what I'm doing even more.

## Friction

- Pains when I am made "wrong" around someone else
- Inflexibility to changes in plans, eg meeting a cute girl in a parking lot and making plans to hang out with them there
- Frustration in communication issues, especially in assuming that someone understands how I feel by body language alone (even when that body language is unclear), ie by not saying anything
- Need to set up a jam session or a date or just any outing with an aquaintance that I want to get to know better
- Confusing moving fast with rushing
- No ways of gaining awareness over my exhaustion, getting better but still not great
- Weak social muscle
- Need to include others in my life more. Whether it be organizing jams, inviting to eat, calling, going over marketing, etc
- No centralized resource for demo-ing marketing materials
- So many ideas about how to grow the business but no execution, possibly due to resistance to growth

## Goals for next month

1. Debut website
1. Get 5 new students
1. Transcribe 5 songs
