Part of the pain I think is coming from defaulting to old masturbation. Like the old masochsitic urge is coming out which is sexualizing being hidden. Honestly, looking for safety right now. Probably a decent chunk of it. 

Contemplating with Notion AI has made me realize how anxious and serious my language is. I feel like if I started to structure it more motivationally, it would change a lot of the way I approach these things.

Need to deal with feelings and trauma around generosity. I'm starting to see a lot of it

Also noticing that career is in fact building. I've now recorded with 4 different engineers, 5 different bands, and upwards of 30 songs. Gigs with at least 10 bands

Listening in to Blue n Boogie I understand so much more of the importance of listening in jazz
- Listening endurance
- Being able to hear form in everyone's solo

It's really awesome getting to talk with my grandparents about jazz. Like they lived through most of it and actually heard these people live. So fucking cool!

I think I'm finally starting to understand like why picking a path has been so difficult? I've narrowed what I want to do down to three essential components that I could choose to work on right now. 
1. Teaching. Quickest route to business/profit but the difficulty is that I don't know anyone in my area that needs lessons so I can't build any kind of marketing persona around this. Or more so, I'm not friends with anyone who this would apply to, so it's impossible to pick one person already in my life that this would benefit. This targets most of my weaknesses, almost too many, and so it's likely to take time to learn the business.
2. Gigs/Session work. This is the part I enjoy the most, but at the moment I think has the smallest return. I won't make a lot but I'll do more of what I love about music. I also know exactly who I can help with this and will often have exactly what I need to make this successful. It's not so much a challenge, but I don't know how to scale it.
3. Online Content Creation. This one feels like the easiest path and I can target my friends specifically by solving their problems for them. But it works with the situation I'm in the best because I'm not in a huge music scene and allows me to create every day. Marketing is easy, but I also am skeptical by how easy this path seems since it seems the most anti personal. I think it's the easiest because I have to rely on other people the least up front. No worrying about scheduling or networking to get more/better gigs and studio time. I get the freedom and flexibility to do whatever I want to do and grow how I want to grow.

This blog post made me realize the ahead/behind mindset is exactly why I'm where I am. It's visible in money, social, labor, everywhere

Use the problem solving mindset to make things happen instead of pork on personal project s

In the calm, I now see the antisocial behavior as being derivative of needing a break. Like "I'm not taken care of, so I definitely can't take care of you." As a byproduct, I find myself being more generous and caring when I feel full.

What I'm learning today is that a SINGLE FULL DAY OFF is enough to recover most my energy. I feel so much better today

Also discovering I think the reason for difficulty choosing between three routes, especially teaching, is because the two routes I know (online, gigs) are targeting people I already know and am friends with. Teaching is a complete unknown because I don't have parent friends, so I'm not helping anyone I directly understand

One thing I'm terrified of is that if I stop worrying about how people will think about me, I'll be a dick. Or even that just asserting myself is being a dick to people I care about. Noticing this with Isra.

Also a part of generosity I struggle with is going above and beyond. Noticing this today when preparing for the gig with Isra. I'm reluctant to do things like supply my kit, bring my sound system, etc. basically anything that would set me apart, I'm somewhat reluctant to do. I could have a hand in making every show I play at better for All drummers involved, but I'm so concerned with my own equipment I dont.

Als just a blanket of anxiety I'm holding onto.

Wished I'd worked out today.

Through the trials of my depression and the season of cutting away, I think the best thing I can really do is hold onto the habits and goals id set for myself for dear life. Like keep working with diet, exercise, meditation, and practice goals until I understand where I'm going with it all again or want to.

The thing I'm really starting to see is that there's so much grief right now, and confusion. I know I have to commit to one thing with much greater depth, but figuring out what that one thing is is tumultuous. Like I'll be leaving all my friends at Starbucks, even my friends in the scene, to pursue something bigger. And that feels like I'm abandoning them. It all has me confused, the idea of a tribe. Because if I want to make more money, it's gonna mean either abandoning all the people I currently serve and picking a new like core community, or finding a way to bring what I serve to so many more people. And picking the path that leads me there is equally as daunting. Like what do I commit to?

It feels like that phase after a break up where you're not fully broken up yet but you aren't together like it'll take a couple times to commit

Some part of me feels hopeless, like I'll never be able to build the life I want to build as a drummer. Like coming to Emory to pick up a coffee...the things I see in them is they all have so much structure. A defined life. They'll be able to help people, save lives, afford whatever they want. They'll never have to make a decision again. They'll fall in love while they're here or get to move to a city. And I feel like I'll never get to experience that again. Not the way I'm living. Like I'll always have a half assed life. I'll never have a family. And it feels so cliche, but also true. And the effort it would require to extend myself more here, to create a better experience. They look so put together, so distinguished, so structured. And it's so beautiful. I compare it with all my friends, the scene, the shows we play. They're all so dirty, disorganized. But content? It's like...the standard is much lower. It's Punk. It's for good causes, but they don't even make money for that. Every pot I'm in I feel constricted by. Both Starbucks and the scene are not going to survive in the new world I'm creating.

It feels so good to talk about all this again. To not just numb it all. I feel like I'd been in such a haze, but I'm starting to notice that the numbness of holding onto everything is so much worse than any of the suffering of sitting and dealing with or listening to the emotions. ChatGPT may very well be the worst solution to all of this. It just de-realizes everything. For the first time in weeks, I at least feel like myself. Capable of listening and being curious about what I'm struggling with.

Intentions
- Meditate
- Practice
- Tear down
- workout?
- Leave
I wish I could exercise 🥲

Noticing the lack of self love coming out in different ways now. Woke up in this haze of horniness and all I could think about was being strapped to Brandi's shoe and used. Need to dissect

Generosity issues flaring up when offering to use my kit and cymbals. Maybe not so much generosity as it is I feel like James is forcing it out of me when I don't want to do it. So it's a bit of both, reluctance to give out of inconvenience and stinginess but also feeling obligated to do it. Trying to look at it like a professional though as it is my job.
