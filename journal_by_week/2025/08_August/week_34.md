It's all a fear of being seen. Any refognizition at home--compliments on my hat, questions about where I'm going, etc--are heightened versions of being witnessed. Gets exacerbated on a stage. I avoid anything that draws attention to my

Now that trial reels are a thing, can start uploading all vids as TikTok's and reels and and only let the good reels go public

Part of resistance to curiosity comes from seeing mom's curiosity as either patronizing, derivative, or suspicious. It creates guilt within me. Disruptive? Antagonizing?

In such a bad mood right now. So defensive. Super stressed. I have to open and now I don't think I'll be getting home until 9 PM. Dad's also getting drunk and I'm scared I'm gonna have to drive him. Noticed for the first time some interactions with my mom. She was telling me all about her friend that we're meeting. I really didn't care, but it felt like she was trying to drag excitement out of me. Reminded me of relationships, when they wouldn't stop talking. When it was physically obvious I wasn't in a great place, but they weren't emotionally engaging. Keeping it surface level and pretending that I'm okay. Trying to force what they want to say when I'm not even here for it. And it really pissed me off. Idk, I'm probably just hungry. Having a really hard time sitting with this. It makes me feel invisible. Like that time I had that breakdown with Jess when she wouldn't stop talking about Lyle. It's the exact same. I feel invisible danger

How much work am i wiling to put out for $60

I've really missed the depth of social landscape. It's been obvious how much I've been missing this today, had a vulnerable conversation with Amanda and I left it feeling so good. I'm not sure if this is a result of meditation, of having a proper rest day yesterday, or just beginning to integrate the avoidant.

Intentions for practice:
- Gauntlet
- Run through Isra set
- Make forms
Still need to outline the social experiment scheme

Part of what's been missing from my life is that vulnerability. I notice it missing with customers as much as coworkers and friends. I think a lot of it comes from not having learned how to recreate the energy of Andy in my life. His connectedness, being, and curiosity

Just had a deep conversation with Amanda about avoidance. It's the first time in a while I've had that level of vulnerability. I've missed it! I forget that that's always the antidote. I feel like the reason I'm getting back to this like stable state of being able to detach from problems is because I'm prioritizing meditation more. It needs to stay that way, I've forgotten how good it is. It frees up my mind to bring other people in by thinking of them more, having more curiosity about their lives. It really changes so much.

Rushing is the same in life as it is in music. Living with expediency doesn't mean rushing. It means playing fast, but still on time and on pace

Part of the resistance to making the big moves is that I'm still scared of taking that full leap. Like even if these tactics don't work...okay knowing that these tactics would work is terrifying. It's terrifying to feel like I could actually just become a full time drummer, but at the same time all of that is directly in my hands and what I make correlates to how hard and smart I work

What do I want to know for analyzing songs? I'm building a taxonomy 
- Artist
- Date
- General form
- Where are the fills (ie towards the end of phrases, non existent)
- Fill characteristics (ie nonexistent, toms at the end of verses)
- Genre

This already feels like too much but it's comprehensive enough to learn so much meh

I'm starting to both notice and hear the strength of how I hold my sticks in other drummers. Like how important keeping fingers on the stick and wrist movements are that I've been trying to get comfortable with for so long

Intentions
Eat 30 sleep 90 meditate 30 walk 40 run 50 practice 180

In practice I haven't liked the enthusiasm and excitement. It's something I like in my dreams but with my mom, Jess, Calista, and even Brandi now I always see it as a painful experience and terrifying one

I think a big part of the whole social thing comes from motivation, like before the motivation was both to connect and impress. Lately what I've felt is this defensiveness, like I have to hide my issues again. Almost like I've believed completeness comes from being able to exclusively deal with all these problems on my own without talking to others. There's also this--I guess delusional--belief that in order to be a teacher or a leader or even just strong around others, it means placing myself above them. That being humble or on the same plane = shrinking myself. That Being strong means being invulnerable. Another part is that my issues have dealt so closely with my family that I've felt like I've had to constantly lie around them. And the people I'm close with. I think it's all tied into avoidance. It's not who I want to be. Maybe vulnerability is always a risk that I have to make an effort to do, and that's okay. I've just fallen back into that mindset of seeing people as pawns and it's a mindset I take great shame in. I want to work more with these feelings today. I haven't even been willing to be vulnerable with myself it seems. It's another place that I feel like meditation really helps. But I think more than anything, I need to dig into that secret pleasure side of the avoidant. I see it so clearly but I've yet to write about it

I also really want to take some time and write out the new future vision for my career, I feel like for once I could turn it into a plan. And also talk more about the difference between expediency and rushing. So much on my mind, but it feels good

Beginning to grow an aversion to unhealthy foods, creating feelings of disgust is workinf #progress

Three ways to go from here:
- What is my role in all this? What am I unwilling to acknowledge?
- How can I reshape the narrative?
- What are the secret pleasures that I haven't been willing to admit?
Let go of control

So I wanted to just I guess like do a little bit of a brain dump of
dinner tonight because after everything I've talked about yesterday
and discovered yesterday with all the avoidance stuff. A lot of it
was popping up with my mom today. I think it all kind of started
earlier in the day Where I don't know I think I began to realize how
much I've walked away from any desire to like connect with people or
engage with them to feel generous or curious about them and instead I
care about is me you know my experience which is something that like
for so long it worked really hard to get away from and it's like The
further I get into this aspect of my career or my life or whatever
the more I get selfish I become. Maybe it's not that I become more
selfish. It's just that I seem to realize how much of my desire for
peace and happiness or contentedness, sir growth Where driven by
other people how it's all been rooted in like a cynicism or a spite
you know like I wanted to find peace to make my last ex jealous, or
to impress my parents or like at work. I wanted to be social because
I wanted to impress the people I worked with And it's like I cared so
much about what other people thought but now it's like all these
influencers have kind of left and I am really struggling to even want
to be at peace again and it feels like the more I gain like any sense
of interest strength the more it feels like I'm selfish with it or
that I'm bound to abuse it. Like today at work one of my coworkers is
someone that I used to be really vulnerable with but recently it
feels like I haven't been able to access that part of myself or just
haven't chose to or haven't felt safe too, and I don't know she
opened up to me about some stuff and there were points where I just
didn't care in that kind of like makes me feel awful. you're just it
feels like I've become shut off and heartless in a way and it's like
after we talked for a while. I felt like I could be that person again
like I started to get more curious talk more about it and felt like I
wanted to help or at least listen and I felt better after it, but
I've missed that vulnerability and it makes me feel like I've been
hiding, but then I have also noticed that like I used to have the
strong drive to socialize with everyone that came through the
drive-through but now it's easy and I don't care you know I used to
wanna be better for the store I work at and now no one around me
cares so why should I and then like where this comes to another
points tonight I went to dinner with my mom and her friend. She was
excited and she was telling me how excited she was and I felt like I
was in danger you know I felt cynical I felt closed off. I didn't
think I was able to hold any kind of conversation we picked up my
brother and it was the same way. I didn't wanna talk to them even
wanna be there like my mom was so happy and something about that just
was driving me crazy and it's like a mimics a lot of what I felt in
relationships before you know like I've been with people who are
exactly like that where they're just talk and talk and talk. The be
excited about something and I'll be in pain and I won't know how to
listen. I won't care and I'll get frustrated that I'm feeling all of
these Things you know I'll get upset that I can't even respond. I'll
get frustrated that I'm so angry at her with all the meanwhile like I
can't change it I just sit there and I fume in silence like I'm
avoiding something and that's what happened in the car just she kept
talking and I never felt like I was being acknowledged you know like
she wanted to talk, but I don't feel like I was part of that and
later on my brother tried to talk to me about you know my work my job
my business and I climbed up. I know how to talk about it and I felt
frustrated. It's like even on the way home we dropped everyone off.
It was just me and my mom and I was scared she was being so nice and
so positive and it made me uncomfortable like I wasn't there or being
seen. I don't know. I'm in a really confusing spot right now where I
see that I have avoidant issues, but it feels like socially. I've
like I guess regressed to the point that I'm like terrified of
connection even when it's all I've wanted right now. I don't want it
at all. I just wanna be alone.

What am I feeling?
- Frustrated that I haven't been searching for the depth of connection and peace I once wanted and still desire
- Mad at my mom's excitement
- mad about the apathy I've felt towards people I'm close to
- Disappointment in how I can't be excited when my mom is
- Envious of my mom's joy and enthusiasm 
- Scared I'll never reach that depth, peace, curiosity again, or that those things will always be vehicles for my self
- Furious at the ways my avoidant personality has separated me from my partners
- Guilty about the time I locked Jess out of my room
- Guilty
- Prideful as a defense against the pains I might be causing
- Frustrated that I don't even have the same curiosity about myself that I used to have, that I'd rather go to ChatGPT than listen to my own problems
- Frustrated that in these situations I'm having such a difficult time letting go
- Scared that I'm in danger when my mom gets excited 
- Worried that I'll never overcome this and that my relationships will always be doomed to the same problem 
- Scared that I'm watching myself become a heartless villain
- Sad
- Ambivalent about how little I want to hear about other people's problems now, seeing them as a source of drama that needs to be eradicated
	- Frustrated at the level of constraint this provides in conversation and my life in general
- Scared that my more confrontational nature will distance me from people and runs counter to the mindfulness and peace I want to show up with
- Terrified
At some point, I have to do the hard work of forgiving her. The hard work of realigning to my social goals. Of acknowledging my part in all of this. Of accepting that I'm afraid of opening my heart to her. Accepting that all the terrifying things in my head are just thoughts, and the only way to let go is to acknowledge

Why the fuck is Mr Robot so dark. I don't think I'm gonna keep watching it, it's good but puts me in such a bad mood

A lot on my mind right now. Haven't really stopped all day. Part of that's good like I've done a great job with diligence. Lots of practice. Progress transcribing. One thing I'm noticing is that just learning the part is no longer enough. I think I really need to be diligent about recording to make sure I'm matching notes only the notes but the feelings behind them. Like my awareness is expanding to the extent that I now know how important the feeling is behind a lot of drumming, but I'm not yet aware of how my playing converts into a feeling 

The dream from last night keeps coming up. Also I think I flirted with Jess from work a little? Also dad's weight is starting to worry me.

The main questions for each genre:
- who is the bass following?

When I look deeper, there's a lot about women I feel disgusted by. I think that's why I try to mold them. It's not a like vomit disgust, more like a shadow desire? It's hard to explain. Almost like taboo or off limits. Like when I see their jewelry, it feels like I'm looking at loose hair in a bath drain. When I see their shoes, it's a mixture between wanting to jack off into them and vomit. With some of their styles or the way they wear their hair...idk man. I remember back playing dolls with Yujin, and now I look back and feel disgusted. I think some avoidance comes from here, like the molding is an aversion to the disgust. By having my space be invaded by these things.

I've never rehearsed playing a head of or behind the beat, so that's why I can't recreate it. I've also never A/B tested songs for feeling, so I don't generally know how to recreate feelings

Weird nightmare last night where I got ass raped by DJ from work while my girlfriend, who was about to break up with me, got fucked by some guy that, due to the rape, both of them considered me dumped

An app that uses ChatGPT (or something similar) AI to create MIDI drum tracks

Need to become like hyper attuned to energy levels of a song, which is currently non existent, so that in different genres I can begin analyzing how dofferent grooves and fills contribute. Good way to go about this: every 4 bars ask: higher lower or same? At least to start out, get a relative grasp

Gonna do an extra long practice today. Save the run for after.

Really want an automated accounting software to keep track of income and outcome streams, YNAB possibly but something I can do reviews with

Even all the suicide fears come from this place of being afraid that me confronting him will cause him to leave, suicide being an avenue of leaving

Unconfrontational because I don't want my dad to leave. If he rejects me when I'm happy, no way he won't when I'm sad or angry, when that couldn't be further from the truth

The pity with my dad is getting worse. We went out to dinner today and seeing the way he got this childlike excitement around unhealthy food, and all I felt was this sensation between embarrassment and depression in my gut. Like watching a sick person poison themselves. Seeing the fuck it mentality my mom talked about. And it makes it so much worse that I hate I see this way, and that I see so clearly now how much I feel ostracized by trying to choose healthier options, like I'm letting them down. Maybe I'm being a good influence and maybe that's all I can do? But is it egotistical to even see myself as a good influence? It feels like I'm hurting them by eating healthy. Like I'm breaking up with them or inciting self-hatred. Maybe it's not so much pity as it is feeling like I'm hurting them and feeling guilty about that. Like I'm watching a malnourished soul consume itself. And I'm just trying to understand what's being projected because I know this has little to do with him

It's because I blame myself. Knowing what I know now, I see the way he averts his gaze, how he eats, how he drinks, how often he's angry, how long he sits at his desk, how much he cares...it all makes me feel so guilty. Like looking into a mirror. Like he spent 28 years of his life in misery for me and my brothers. It feels so selfish to even think that. Like he's trapped in this maze. I'm glad it's past this point of hopelessness but fuck man, this feels so much worse somehow. I guess because now the feeling has raised beyond the realm of numb to a surface pain.

Even now I feel the strongest desire to numb, and I'm indulging it. I don't have a good reason why, I'm just getting a hot chocolate to numb. There's so much pain here

I'm projecting onto him the depth of my weight insecurities, my disdain for corporate life, my value of time, my dreams, etc. it's also a fear that that's what I could become if I don't try hard enough now. And that he'll find out I feel this way. And that I'll use this information publicly for fame and drive him to hate himself

I feel so guilty. Like somehow I'm the reason he's stuck like this. That I would kill myself if it meant I could free his chains. But also that trying to confront it would make him kill himself.

And it's like in all of this I just keep thinking about how many of my problems stem from this fear of rejection. How I've been so non confrontational because I want people to like me and simultaneously fearing they'll kill themselves. How much I've just agreed with people and been excitable just to impress them and keep them in my life. How little I've ever asked of anyone because I don't want them to leave. How much I've become exactly who I think they want to keep that around. I don't want that anymore.

I feel like to help this stuff with dad, I need to do two things.
1. Monthly family hike? Something to get him out and connect deeper, a space to actually talk since we don't really have one
2. Be myself. Work through the emotions here.

One of my biggest fears is that if I move past the avoidance, I'll become highly critical. That if I can start confronting him about things, or anyone, that the inner critic and inner cynic will leak out into the world. That I'll call him out on shit and he'll kill himself. Or that I'll be honest enough with the world about all the shit I've dealt with that I won't care about him any more, will be oublicly honest without empathy and will drive him to resent me and himself. That I'll drive him further away. That everything I would do by becoming not avoidant would drive a wedge further and further between us. That it would cause my parents to get a divorce. That my brothers would hate me. That all my family will blame me for ruining my dad. That I'll hurt him. Or I'll get yelled at by him. Or be misunderstood. I'm terrified of who I'd become if I stopped trying to be liked and started trying to be real. How much of who I am and want to be would change. That I would betray a noble path for one of indulgences. That I'd use my strength and power for harm. That's enough for now.

God, can you help me with this one? Why am I so afraid of my dad killing himself? Or leaving in general?

Stuck in a numbing loop

Some avoidance, or at least in the sense of asking for favors, comes from wanting to be liked so bad that I remain positive. Noticing this when talking to Andrew about song, I like it a lot but there's some things I noticed that I won't say. Also with asking people to come to gigs, I care more about keeping the reciprocity one sided and doing more for them so I don't feel like I owe them, or even that I owe them from the offset so showing up is my way of relating to keep them around. Like I find myself just agreeing with everyone

How do I get more people to come out to shows? I think it should be less about getting them to come out and more about 
1. Building a show they want to come see and
2. Just making them aware that the show exists by individually reaching out
But it all triggers the avoidance tendencies. Like I guess it's twofold of I feel weird inviting people to a show that I'm a hired gun for and I also just feel weird inviting people to a show? I also don't know how to sell it and I think I'm letting that be an excuse

I've found myself relaxing into a soft smile much more recently

Held eye contact with Kendal (cute girl) for at least 3 seconds before walking away! I was disappointed at first until I remembered that's so much longer than usual. I wish I had talked to her, thing is she held it too and we smiled at each other. I think she's just nice, but for once I feel like I can imagine a version of this situation where I connect with her. My heart warmed up this time and I was scared but I also felt love. But I felt the avoidant come out pretty soon, I think I just don't have the habits yet to move forward from that. Like wave or even just think straight

Aversion to attention because I was rewarded for silence and punished for the drawl

Craving things that lack nutritional value right now. Eg cappuccinos, sweet cream, sugar. I'm thinking because I didn't eat enough carbs (or any food really) last night so my body is just looking for an energy source. Want to acknowledge it so I can approach with intention, need to figure out healthy source of carbs at SBUX

I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me on the outside of the Athens music community is telling myself I am. I could just as easily introduce myself

Stay with the avoidant til we get home

Did a REALLY good job during this rehearsal of playing soft enough to listen to everyone else, honing in on everyone else, being rehearsed enough to adjust to them on the fly. Having this confidence has made it SO MUCH LESS PRESSURE to stay pocketed. Because time is no longer me dependent, balancing with the bass and guitar parts makes it so much easier to have fun. I'm also genuinely enjoying the company of other people my age and I want so much more of this just getting along with people and getting to play with other musicians. Like pocket playing is so much less pressure

Why did it all the sudden become draining?

I feel like the footwear fetish might've been derived from not being able to look them in the eyes or in the face. Sexualizing the part that felt safe to see, where I was looking most

The minimalist card design is cool for in person, but for poster boards it doesn't really work. Need something that has all the info on one side and is thinner. Maybe a different one for that? One that at least advertises services, because I look at the card and think, so what?

The best pipepline: do it for free until you UNDERSTAND the cost. Like take new opportunities for any ROI, only start creating definite demand as you understand associated costs
