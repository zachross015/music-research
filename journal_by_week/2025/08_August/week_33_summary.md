# Week 33: Fighting Disease

I treaded alot this week. Struggled to progress. 

I started out the week sick. Stuck in bed on Monday and barely moving Tuesday, I fell behind on my goals for the week. The motivation to accomplish anything was lacking. Starting off on this foot put me in a rush by the end of the week, yet all the meanwhile I still strived for my best. I was battling mental anguish in negotiating with The While, contemplating what people would say when I finally built the review forms, and harboring the cynicism that had been unearthed; all the while recovering from the flu. Energy levels were low. Motivation was low. Inspiration was non-existent. 

I managed eight hours of practice, two difficult workouts, and three 40 minute meditations. Grandpa also gave me Lydia's iphone. All in all, it was a recovery week. All that was accomplished was the tread. Some weeks are like this, and that's okay. 

## Achievements

1. Negotiated and rejected The While amicably while also setting them up with someone else
2. Responded to Jacob's musical role expediently 
3. Hill climbs. Those were a bitch but I completed ALL of them

## Friction

- Long delay between recieving and responding to opportunities, letting it linger is a mental tax residual of avoidance
- Avoidance in general is an issue that I think needs to be worked on
- Still haven't finished making the forms, likely also from the avoidant
- Didn't transcribe a new song
	- I *believe* the reason is that I've temporarily exhausted Max Roach as a teacher. Need to switch to another drummer AND dig deeper on what I am studying
- Lacking inspiration and motivation
- Lacking creative outlet
- Need a couple of days off
- Lack of connection, likely from avoidance but also numbing and failing to acknowledge other's strengths/feel gratitude
- 

## Goals

1. Attend to avoidant wounds
1. Come up with comprehensive yet simple review form for soloist support
	- Start by understanding/listing out what I am unfamiliar with
	- Open up the review form OR make it as an email list item
1. CREATE REVIEW FORMS
1. Gain performance comfort for Isra set
