# Week 34: Avoiding the Avoidant

I spent the last week in the depths of avoidance. It began with an Artist's date in which I struggled to get comfortable. I went from Rome to Marrietta in hopes of finding solace. I found none. I sat and journaled and ranted about the pains I'd suffered growing in an avoidant household. 

As the week progressed, so did the emergence of the avoidant. There was an air of hopelessness that turned to guilt and shame. I began looking at my father(s) of different trades in a way that brought out darkness. My dad with his alcohol and career problems, Danny with his career growth, and Angelo with his isolation. I blamed myself for all of them and saw my pains in them, although all I wrote about was how I felt depressed when I saw them. 

Like a seed, the plant of the avoidant slowly grew into something bigger. Shame turned to depression, anger, guilt, frustration, desire, and a slew of other emotions. On another outting Saturday, I happened upon a beautiful poem gifted by the Muse laying out exactly what I struggled with. Fear of being seen. Love and connection found in ignorance, rejection, and guilt. Fear of eye contact as a proxy for being seen. How my foot(wear) fetish and size fetish may have developed in tandem as sexualizing the thing I allowed myself to look at on a woman. How these issues also made it impossible to play on a stage since I didn't want to be seen, and made it difficult to lock in with other musicians because I wouldn't listen. 

Ultimately, it came down to not seeing because I didn't want to be seen, and not listening because I didn't want to be heard.

In spite of this struggle, or maybe because of it, I accomplished more than I sought to achieve. I practiced for nearly 14 hours. I completed all my to do lisk tasks, including getting the balls to create and send feedback requests. When it came time to practice with other musicians, the secret of a good pocket was finally revealed to me. I've begun taking steps to deepen connections with everyone. I'm letting go of the avoident.

## Achievements

1. Practiced for 14 hours
2. Recognized when I needed rest, food, water, etc, and enacted those instead of avoiding them to postpone growth.
3. Began seeing nutrients as vital
4. Felt pocketed for the first time
5. Learned all of Isra set
6. Approached Isra about money after the set confidently
7. Set up potential fill-in work with Frigga Five
8. Sent out review forms to Isra and James

## Friction

- Got really heated with James when I couldn't explain to him the time signature of my riffs and embarassed when, as a drummer, I couldn't count along to them. It took me a while to decompress
- Avoided hanging out with Isra and James longer in favor of alone time (avoidant time)
- Avoided phone call with Jackson
- No progress on getting new students
- No progress on setting up new band
- Weak social muscle, often the cause of apathy in relationships, tension here is almost always because of conflict, being too "dumb" to explain something, trying to not enter certain topics in conversation, not being comfortable speaking my truth
- Living life rushing, possibly as a symtpom of avoidance
- Premature optimization too much. Trying to figure out long term systems for things I havent even gotten in the practice of, like transcribing or scheduling or payment or whatever. These arent actual problems yet
