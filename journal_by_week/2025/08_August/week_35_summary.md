# Week 35: Professional Development

Started this week on the wrong foot. Had a gig Monday, procrastinated my review until Tuesday, then had a mental shutdown on Wednesday after a brief confrontation with my mom and brother about why I didn't want to pick up a part time programming position. The good news is, this meltdown was part of a larger scheme of avoidant tendencies which I'm beginning to unwind. This specific instance was the result of having the negative reation, distancing myself, then coming back when I was ready to talk and resolving the issue head on by communicating my feelings. I've become more confrontational since the onset. I've also realized these avoidant tendencies are connected to a much more diverse array of symptoms that are beginning to surface. One of them being a gross aversion to being wrong, and another being a communication issue where I assume others know how I feel about something without ever verbally saying so. One instance that arised this week was that my family tried to push Kellie hiking with me after I ran into a bear in the woods, I noticed a much larger anger arising than usual because I had felt like--through body language--I had been communicating for quite some time that I don't want that. I've realized that I've never communicated that my hikes are spontaneous and times of solitudes and that my frustration is less about them pushing and more about my inability to communicate this boundary. So all-in-all, most of the avoidant issues I'm suffering from are matters of communication.

I wasn't able to get back on the right foot after this. I spent the last two days phsyically and mentally exhausted. Although I stopped short of my exercises and didn't get more than 4 hours of dilligent practice, I continued my initiative to work with others and transcribed the rest of Surrender and sent out review forms to Isra, James, and Amanda. Ending the week catching up on rest.

## Achievements

1. Sent out all the review forms to my clients
1. Broke through the avoidant barrier (finally)
1. Rested when it became obvious how exhausted I was
1. Ran a 10k!

## Friction

- No jam session set up. Mainly due to time constraints and energy levels, at least that's what I'm telling myself. Truthfully it would be so simple. But I'm terrified.
- Offer remains unorganized. This one was an energy thing. Same with transcribing. I could hardly get off the couch.
- Energy levels were low and I'm entirely sure why. I think it's a mixture of poor sleep which made it hard to remain intent in my diet. Monday was a full on sprint and so was half of Tuesday, Wednesday was the breakdown. Everything else was trying to recover from Wednesday

## Goals

1. Make a jam session
1. Organize offer
1. Transcribe 2 songs
