Part of the reason I wasn't great at soloing/supporting is I was hardly experiencing the music I was making. I didn't feel the tension release that makes music so special

When I'm going to a coach or lessons teacher, what do I expect from them? Or hope for? Or fear?
- for fitness coach, I want them to take full control. To grow me in every way possible. I don't want to have to think about it. Maybe I have a general goal, like running a 10k, but in reality I'm just oblivious to what being good at fitness means and want someone else to take the reins and lead the way
- For music, I have a general direction I want to go, but what I want is a conduit. Someone who can shortcut the process to learning by giving me certain exercises, or can let out advice, or can give good feedback on what I'm doing wrong

Getting to a point with each subset of my business that they're growing too big to maintain on my own. I think I also have some fictional belief that more work = higher quality service. Had these same problems in programming. Need to figure out how to move faster without creating more work for myself

What is the anxiety begging me to do?
- finish forms
- at least write out a pipeline and get it out of my head

Everything I need to know for a gig:
- where
- What time is load in
- Rehearsals
- Backline or no

Why did everything with Zoe this morning feel so triggering?
- Argument in general or conflict is rage baiting for me. I still haven't worked out how to handle it mindfully
- Hungry

Avoidance/resistance gets heightened the closer I get to people I want in my life. Thinking about a healthy and happy and accepting community now, it seems so lovely but also terrifying

I feel like I really just need to visualize how cool the future could look being part of the in crowd

Energy being drained by having to send this review, but also proud of myself of the risks and changes I've been making around professionalism, ie money and feedback and responsibility and communication 

Website should have a Home Screen with accolades, pages for sessions, gigs, and lessons (under services), a page on referral information, contact information

See so clearly now how much the foot(wear) fetish evolved from avoidance, I get hornier now looking people in the face now that I have permission

Intentions:
- Nap
- Plan Week 
- Walk Mu
- Meditate
- End night early

Part of the reason I don't value what I do is because I've never had to hire a musician, much less a good one. So I don't know exactly how much I'd pay for a good one over a bad one

I think a lot of my issues are still a matter of priority, especially with social and avoidance stuff. Like prioritizing todo list tasks over connection, the next thing over the present. The avoidance almost seemed like a way of further fueling the problem of being in a rush. Like if someone comes up to me while I'm working, I feel like I'll be much happier if I stop to talk to them for longer. Or if I see someone I know out in public, instead of staying focused on what I'm trying to do, stop and talk to them. Who knows what I may find?

I did it!

How do I handle payment here? How do I be confrontational? Today and tonight is like huge progress, how do I end it? I'm worried that because I didn't say anything earlier, it's unexpected? I want to just say "how do you want to handle payment?" I feel like that's great. I'm not prepared for like conflict here. Maybe there won't be any, but if there is you can do this. I believe in you
