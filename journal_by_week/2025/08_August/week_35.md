Part of the reason I wasn't great at soloing/supporting is I was hardly experiencing the music I was making. I didn't feel the tension release that makes music so special

When I'm going to a coach or lessons teacher, what do I expect from them? Or hope for? Or fear?
- for fitness coach, I want them to take full control. To grow me in every way possible. I don't want to have to think about it. Maybe I have a general goal, like running a 10k, but in reality I'm just oblivious to what being good at fitness means and want someone else to take the reins and lead the way
- For music, I have a general direction I want to go, but what I want is a conduit. Someone who can shortcut the process to learning by giving me certain exercises, or can let out advice, or can give good feedback on what I'm doing wrong

Getting to a point with each subset of my business that they're growing too big to maintain on my own. I think I also have some fictional belief that more work = higher quality service. Had these same problems in programming. Need to figure out how to move faster without creating more work for myself

What is the anxiety begging me to do?
- finish forms
- at least write out a pipeline and get it out of my head

Everything I need to know for a gig:
- where
- What time is load in
- Rehearsals
- Backline or no

Why did everything with Zoe this morning feel so triggering?
- Argument in general or conflict is rage baiting for me. I still haven't worked out how to handle it mindfully
- Hungry

Avoidance/resistance gets heightened the closer I get to people I want in my life. Thinking about a healthy and happy and accepting community now, it seems so lovely but also terrifying

I feel like I really just need to visualize how cool the future could look being part of the in crowd

Energy being drained by having to send this review, but also proud of myself of the risks and changes I've been making around professionalism, ie money and feedback and responsibility and communication 

Website should have a Home Screen with accolades, pages for sessions, gigs, and lessons (under services), a page on referral information, contact information

See so clearly now how much the foot(wear) fetish evolved from avoidance, I get hornier now looking people in the face now that I have permission

Intentions:
- Nap
- Plan Week 
- Walk Mu
- Meditate
- End night early

Part of the reason I don't value what I do is because I've never had to hire a musician, much less a good one. So I don't know exactly how much I'd pay for a good one over a bad one

I think a lot of my issues are still a matter of priority, especially with social and avoidance stuff. Like prioritizing todo list tasks over connection, the next thing over the present. The avoidance almost seemed like a way of further fueling the problem of being in a rush. Like if someone comes up to me while I'm working, I feel like I'll be much happier if I stop to talk to them for longer. Or if I see someone I know out in public, instead of staying focused on what I'm trying to do, stop and talk to them. Who knows what I may find?

I did it!

How do I handle payment here? How do I be confrontational? Today and tonight is like huge progress, how do I end it? I'm worried that because I didn't say anything earlier, it's unexpected? I want to just say "how do you want to handle payment?" I feel like that's great. I'm not prepared for like conflict here. Maybe there won't be any, but if there is you can do this. I believe in you

Post workout and drums: don't feel dopamine obsessed anymore. Like those things are the cure

Footwear is losing its charm

Want the confidence to play with ANY musician. Like to look at a band, see an excellent player, and have the confidence to immediately reach out and be like "we should jam"

Need to stop thinking of social interactions as distractions and instead as boosts. Eg working out with someone else pushes me, makes me more diligent and accountable, and makes it more safe to go further. Maybe not always the case with learning or self-development but definitely so for music, meditation, etc

Why does the idea of Brandi liking me feel so repulsive? I know it's connected to avoidance but I don't know how. Like I'm avoiding behaviors that would give her that impression? Idk it's the same in relationships too. Same with my mom and dad at times. I think it's connected to not wanting to be seen in a way.

It's really important to be friendly with the staff at the place I bring people. Increases confidence as well as being a tip from Never Eat Alone

Singing BB's theme to myself today. Makes me want to cry, keep thinking of being held as a baby

Frigga Five might be really good for my album

He looks at you with Joy and admiration. With a soft smile. With complete presence. He's calm and calming and confident and relaxed.

I shouldn't have to have a nervous breakdown for you to listen to me

Let go of the idea you need to be poor to learn how to be rich 

Let go of idea that there's no part-time remote work that can accomplish what Starbucks does for you, might be a notable change. Deal with insecurity here. Swallow pride and be willing to be wrong. Sometimes this is the emotional explosion you need

Sitting in the back corner of a graveyard and it seems like this is the only part of the graveyard that wasn't maintained and I'm not really sure why I'm here. I come up to Ellijay sometimes because the place feels like healing to me. It's a nice day. It's cool. It's like everything last night made me have to escape. I'm in a lot of pain. It's like I knew or I know that this pain must've been here to begin with, but it sucks. It's like an hour and a half drive in the whole time. My head was spiraling. You know this morning. All I could do is think about it all. It's like I get it how it happens you know when the emotion comes up at all the thoughts come up too It's like this emotion is just so painful that it's hard to sit with. You know it feels the same way as when I was dealing with all the anxious attachment issues in the same way when I was going through my break ups.

One of the main parts of it is like it's really hard to be a member of my family sometimes like I feel like I'm a disappointment to everyone in it like every time this conversation comes up about you know I could be using my degree I could be making more money than I'm making Just makes me feel misunderstood or like I'm a burden or like I'm a disappointment. I can't tell if it's because of this avoidant tendency or if I'm just not being heard like I can't tell if I'm not communicating why I can't be a programmer anymore or if no one else is just supportive of me being a musician And building the life that I want to live and I guess it feels like people are supportive to my face, but like I see the way they look at me with like concern you know like we had this whole conversation last night, but it doesn't ever feel like it's the last time I have to have it Like I feel like I've had to tell people so many times like I can't do that anymore. I can't like it makes me wanna kill myself. I don't even really know what I'm getting out here. I just I'm in a lot of pain and I know I'm like grieving and it's like this argument that we all had last night. It wasn't even really an argument, but it was like I just feel guilty. You know like I've offloaded my emotions onto them and I think that's why I struggle with the avoidance stuff is it's like I was confrontational like I didn't avoid the issue. I talked about it and I told them things that I've never talked about before you know I was more transparent about this stuff but now all I feel is guilty for having done so like even if it puts us on the same page it's like what if You know, my brother gets mad at himself for having done these things or what if my mom feels bad about her so like what if all I've done is offloaded it onto them and I just feel guilty about it like I've been carrying all this pain alone and at the same time haven't done anything to make them understand like why I'm doing it or at least like I don't know this is where it goes back to the original thing it's like I can't tell if that's what it is or if they're just so unwilling to support something that I'm only doing because I love to do it. You know if they're so driven by fear finance or whatever that love is hardly a factor And like the whole time you know I villainized my dad, but he seems to be the only one that truly like supports it and doesn't doubt it and doesn't say shit behind my back

And now I'm also just worried that like everyone else's reactions to this stuff it's just gonna detriment me but sometimes it feels like it doesn't matter what I do like they're always going to find a way to resist it in a constantly feels like I'm at odds with I either make them happy or I make me happy And I try to make them understand, but it doesn't feel like anything I can do will. And it's like now all I want is an apology. Or for someone to acknowledge that they hurt me. And I don't think I'll ever get something like that. Like something that I kept thinking about on the way up is that they didn't acknowledge that they shouldn't have goaded me like that until I came and told them it hurt me. Why was I the one to have to come to them? Like yeah I'll be the bigger person, but why were they willing to acknowledge to each other that they hurt me but neither was willing to confront me or apologize? Why did I have to be the one to say something? And that's the kind of thing that makes me realize exactly where my avoidance habits comes from it's like I'm so angry about this too. But I'm also just hurt about the amount of things I've had to hide my entire life and it feels like I'm letting this energy go into the universe which I can't tell if it's a good or bad thing because I'm tired of holding onto it but I'm terrified that by being open and honest about the things that upset me that people will have to tip toe around me or see me as sensitive and treat me like a fucking fragile person because of it. It's like I'm tired of sitting back and being treated this way, being doubted and "supported" to my face but undermined behind my back and I want to stop avoiding it and call people out on this bull shit but I'm terrified that by doing so I'm either going to become a dick or ostracize myself from my family. Because I'm still not even sure how to recover from this confrontation; this conflict, or how to properly deal with it. It feels like every time I have something like this it's a fucking explosion and I can't tell if that's because that's all I'm capable of doing in conflict or if I just have always left things bottled up in my mind for way too long and they always turn into this, which feels more like the truth than anything else.

And the cherry on top of everything lately all I've done is blamed my family for everything wrong in my life, constantly villainizing them as the sources of all my pain and problems, from anxious to avoidance behaviors, and eventually alike last night make me feel like I'm the problem still. Like I'm explosive or mentally ill, like I still have a really long way to go on my own mental journey. That may be true but I feel so guilty about blaming them for all of this. I became this way because of the ways I was raised and people I was around but I constantly expect the worst when I come to them. Like when I went to confront them, some part of me knew they'd be accepting. But leading up to it all I could sense was isolation, detachment, non-understanding, argumentativeness, and those things just completely revved me up until the confrontation became this major ordeal in my mind. Maybe that was just the years of swallowing whatever they gave me. I don't know. But I come to them and I actually talk to them about what I'm feeling and they accept me. They want to understand and I don't do what I can to help them. But I also can't tell if I'm not helping them enough or if they're not trying enough to understand, if they're avoiding it just as much as me. And it keeps circling back to this.

It's like they're trying to help, but I'm not giving them the tools to help appropriately, but I also hate having to explain every minute detail of what I'm feeling to try and convince them or make them understand why I'm doing something a certain way, so it feels patronizing or doubtful when they come up with a "solution" that seems obvious but doesn't work for me. But I also, in the past, have been unwilling to accept help from them because it doesn't fit my vision and I try to have too much control over it. Part of bringing people into my world means that I have to start letting them help. Yet so far, their version of helping has been telling me what to do or suggesting and alternative route that conflicts with my priorities and my ability to manage time and energy. And without being conceited, I have no idea how to explain to them that it would take them reading at least 10 books to understand why I'm doing what I'm doing the way I'm doing it, and even then I couldn't fully explain it.

I just hate feeling like the world is against me. I don't even think it is. Everyone's trying to help and I'm acting like they're pulling me into hell. And at the same time, it legitimately feels like that half the time.

If they knew they were wrong or upsetting me, why weren't they the first to come to me? Why did I have to come to them? Just evidence of the avoidant nature of my family I guess #anger #ranting

One way to increase business is not only book my own gigs but get more gigs for clients. Eg get Isra gigs and offer to play. Same with other bands. If I get good at booking or even get someone else booking, then I'll always have that stream #ideas #business

At some point I need to address the amount of suicidal thoughts I have. Not just as myself, but also the ones I project into to others. Maybe a root of avoidance

Big things from my run:
- I eat better as a result of running. When I run, I don't want to eat poorly or it feels like a waste of energy and time. It makes me recognize the nutrients I need to recover and grow
- When I search for rejection by saying hello to everyone on the run, it pushes me to run faster and harder without pain, and the times it doesn't feel like rejection feel instead like a boost
- Why haven't I jammed with Radley and Eric?
- I can't tell if my frustration with communication comes from the fact that I'm genuinely not being heard, or if I'm not actually communicating anything. Like they keep trying to push Kellie's hiking on me and it's pissing me off, but I'm also unsure if I've ever actually told anyone I don't want to, and I think this plagues every other area of my life

Been trying to figure out why I'm so tired and unmotivated. Factors:
- poor sleep and lack of sleep last night
- Poor diet today, partially from lack of will power due to low sleep
- Dehydrated
But I still showed up. I meditated, practiced, and am about to run

Jam with Frigga Five and bassist from Schmooze. What about Radley?

Look for other musicians looking to build credits to exchange favors

Simplest route:
- Turner mixing?
- Jackson guitar
- Turner bass?

Don't befriend the coffee shop, find the coffee shop that befriends you.

More attractive people sell things better. Another reason to prioritize things like physical fitness, attire, and hygiene 

Do research on clients before I meet with them. Borderline stalk? Know them and know how to talk with them, guide into similarity 

Intentions:
Work
Lesson - 11:30
Walk Mu - 12:15
Workout - 2
Meditate - 3
Practice - 6

Automated booking, reminder, and payment tools to onboard as many clients as possible. Distributed teachers, onboard them and take care of the rest. 
> He gets an email reminding him to book another session for the upcoming week
> She gets an email right after the lesson with a review and reminder to pay

Didn't realize how exhausted I was that's crazy

- Nap
- Meditate
- Lesson
- workout
- Practice

Part of sales means coming together for a mutual benefit or common goal, approaching every "sale" like we are working together to solve a problem: improving their ability to drum with what they can afford #insights #sales

I'll get much more attention from my friends if, instead of studying something like jazz, I studied whatever genre fits the area. This would move my name around Athens quickly

Loans and big money are only when a business model becomes scalable. The fact that I don't know if mine is or not should make it obvious that right now, it's not scalable

Need to start asking myself if ahead of or behind the beat to recognize it more

Labeling is so fucking powerful
