# Week 31: Social Growth and Financial Acceptance

Week started out on the morning after the dog fight between Maddy and Mu. I awoke to a $900 vet bill, yet for the first time was unphased. I'd been through this several times. Several financial setbacks. So what was one more?

That's what I thought going into the week, but there was turmoil. Grief and anger pervaded the week. I decided to approach differently this time, awakening every day with the intention to mentally deal with the grief caused by yet another financial set back. Surprisingly, the new methods I had been working with for setting intentions prior to everything provided a great deal of assistance for accomplishing my goals under the duress of this new financial pressure. In spite of these restraints, I was able to approach the rest of the week mindful. Taking into account the lack of time I was going to have due to vacation helped in being real about what I was capable of accomplishing during the week. The vacation itself--the bachelor party for evan--was a big Letting Go event, applying for once the social skills I had been developing recently. It was pleasant. I flirted with a girl. I talked to 3+ strangers. I took alot of social risks. I noticed how much I've always felt ostracised by groups of men, yet this time I allowed myself to be one of them. I stayed mindful throughout the trip, approaching every day and interaction with intention, even when I was as high as a kite. 

Running in parallel to all of this were many conflicts around my parents, social experiences, and pride in what I do as a musician. I had been running around alot of these issues for some time, but everything about New York made it apparent that one of my biggest battles yet to survive is finding security in my dreams, and creating a life around them. Through excavation, the Stranger identities became known. Deeper excavation revealed deep resentments I had been holding towards my parents for a long time, using my smallness as a way to blame them for my failures and holding over them everything they did "wrong" that made me end up back in their basement. In truth, I've blamed them for my shortcomings, and I think alot of my time at home has been circling around this. I began this next week trying to forgive this about my parents, and understand new ways to motivate my dreams that don't come from spite.

## Achievements

1. Flirted with Dee at the Bowling alley and fell flat on my face
2. Publicly faced rejection when telling people Go Mets! 
3. Found 1 student (Momo)
4. Finished transcribing another song (Daahoud)

## Friction

- Didnt work on the secret pleasures and weight problems. Mostly because other issues came up (eg New York trip)
- The main barrier to sales at this point seems to be primarily caused by limiting beliefs and surrounding community. There aren't enough people in my life trying to succeed in this area of development and it's something I really need to change, otherwise it's going to keep happening. The other side of all this is all rooted in not believing in myself enough
- Began working on appraoching all of life with more intention, but there are still actions I take which cause heedless behaviors (ie drinking caffeine) throughout the day or--on the other side--mind-numbing behaviors like sugar, masturbation, video games, or doomscrolling. It's another area where I really feel like I would benefit from knowing other people who don't struggle with these issues, but I think just remaining mindful of how I approach life and reinforcing the habit of acting with intention is going to work wonders over time
- Conflict in connecting with men, probably derived from relationships with dad and grandpa
- Financial insecurity is causing me to constantly pick bad experiences and stay in debt, I can really do with being smarter here 
- Sales priorities are all out of whack. This app is a good idea, but it may not be a good idea YET. Keep working on it but let it incubate, for now I think building a better offer is way more important. My main limitation at this point is that I don't have enough students, and I think the sooner I can get more the sooner I can leave starbucks and potentially move elsewhere

## Goals

1. Find a better way to organize offer details
2. Delve deeper and heal limited beliefs from childhood
3. Build performance review forms 
   1. Gigs
   2. Recording
   3. Lessons
