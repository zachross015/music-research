# Week 31: 

This week started in New York, or really New Jersey, waiting for a flight home from a life-changing bachelors trip. In the airport, I contemplated my path. The dissonance I was facing. Resentments I'd continued to hold to my parents, Jess, and Amy, and shame I still felt around being a drummer. All of them seemed to climax with the grief which came from leaving New York, a city I'd fallen in love with.

Most of the dissonance came from the financial and social sides of my trip. Seeing insecurity in my future and position in life, both deriving from the fiscal importance my parent's and family placed on every aspect of my existence. The other side came from frustrations with myself in the progress I'd seen. I'd been facing indecision for quite some time. And diverted focus. So coming home from the trip, I'd decided to work smarter. 

Yet I was inhibited throughout the week by a steadily increasing sickness and a pulled muscle in my back. These factors contributed to a mindlessness which made it difficult to focus on what was important. In spite of the circumstances, I remained dillignet. I moved money around to exploit and arbitrage opportunity, which I'd toyed with the idea of for almost a year. I practiced more than I thought I was capable of. Where there was mindlessness, I ensured dilligence was achieved first. Sitting sick at a coffee shop still doing this review. I don't feel motivated, but I'm doing what has to be done. I do this out of love for once.

## Achievements

1. Enacted the arbitrage plan in spite of fears and risk, setting up automated pipelines for savings as well as debt payments in a way that keeps me stress-free
2. Remained dillignet to drum practice, finding ways to put time in (even casually) despite sickness
3. Shared multiple songs with Brandi, which she told me she enjoyed all of. Not something I had the confidence to do with anyone before, but she asked to hear and I believed her for once despite my cynicism
4. Gave my first quote AND offer that came from a place of self-respect while being honest. $212, which was a $50 rate for me and $162 travel (based on mileage and two trips). To an extent, looking for rejection here

## Friction

- Still haven't sat down and built the forms I need for gigs, sessions, and lessons. Not entirely sure why. Easiest thing to say is that there's not enough time, but it's hypothetically such a simple task that it shouldn't even take that much time.
- Sick almost all week long. If it wasn't my throat it was the back pains
- Still need to deal with whatever resentments I'm holding on towards my parents and even other family members. I think it's make it really hard to connect with any of them right now or even talk to them really. Part of it is that now my habits are changing and my life is changing so it's hard to connect with them in ways I used to. But then again, I don't think I really used to all that well. idk
- Alot of disconnect with people. Not in the normal sense, just haven't felt as motivated to get to a deeper level with people? I think it's because it used to be from that place of malice and needing to connect with others pain, but I'm having a really hard time now that I'm out of the gutter and want to connect with a more positive side of vulnerability. Things like excitement and passion and enthusiasm. It scares me in some way
- Lack of forms and centralized offer information station are making selling things more difficult? Like I can talk about everything all day but I think I want the consitency of this kind of platform? Also to make building the webiste easier. Like I'm trying to figure out how to refine each area of influence and offering while also trying to get more feedback and concrete evidence on whats good and what can be improved continually 
- Drumset needs alot of maintanence right now, especially for the low volume setting. Playing on it is showing how many of the screws are stripped and its starting to look like it's just all of them at this point because nothing stays sounding the way I need it to
- Resistance to creating a more quality setup within the home. Not in terms of the space so much as just like making the kit sound as good as it can with the space I have and opening up the possibility to demo recordings there, especially in terms of more lessons oriented videos
- Need more students to make more money to build the business to get better information on things that I can teach
- Need more students so I can eventually move to group classes
- Need to finish the app. It's design and flow is done, just needs programming before I can start the next version, which should be either the exercise workflow, habit tracking, or the social aspect (account)
- Overt cynicism to almost everything in life, in spite of my positive demeanor
- Living in Alpharetta, Georgia
- No church drummer gigsg

Alot of it right now I think boils down to socail proof? Getting the offers together so that I have concrete evidence when I apply for gigs, sell lessons, or work with producers.

## Goals

1. Get forms together
2. Work through familial resentment and shame around drums
3. 1 drum trasncription
