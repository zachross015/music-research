Cool idea for a song with like three guitars would be to have like waves of chord changes like have one I guess like three seconds section or to have like waves of court progressions that follow the breath so like when you're doing like an inhale it'll be like 16th note court changes that are harmonized by each of the guitars and then During the exhale would be just be this long held cord so that it's just kind of like tension, release tension, release cycle #ideas #songs

I'm laying sick in bed but today I'm dreaming a lot about moving out and moving on. I don't think I'm necessarily there yet, but the thought of living with friends again just fills me with like this this huge joy you know the thought of like getting away and being with people where 24 seven we can go out and do something, especially being with roommates who would do like similar things to me that just sounds really amazing right now and something like I'm excited to do and I think I'm trying to mentally create the landscape that's possible you know gigging every Friday night Saturday night and then church gigs and teaching lessons on the other timespending a lot of time practicing and stuff like that. I feel like for once all of this stuff seems possible and not only possible but like it's going to happen.  It feels like really good having the confidence that I am going in the right direction and it's taking time but I'm starting to believe in myself and my drumming abilities and my social abilities enough to say like yeah I'm capable of doing these things.

Something that's been coming to mine. That's like a big limitation of mine right now is just how long it takes for me to respond to anything not just for gigs but like personal life stuff like I feel like I'm not really setting up social opportunities or business opportunities because I'm taking forever to like get back to people And I on another note I think like I don't necessarily have to live with someone else right now but like hanging out with friends it's something I feel like I really wanna do right now. I really need just in a friendly capacity you know I love being around my friends, especially the ones that decide to keep around and I feel like it's gonna open up business opportunities as much as as much as it is just going to deep in my friendships.

A really cool challenge with the vagabonds would be to create a big enough name for it that a kid out there dreams of playing in it. Not touring as a group so much as finding people located at each city I'm playing at and, without rehearsal, go on stage and play a good show. Requires dependable people at each place.

If I become the guy that knows all the drummers, I become the person people come to for both drums and drummers

Edging sugar/protein right now, trying to force myself to last until the end of my shift. I can do this

Things I don't like about new video:
- takes half the video to get to the emotional part
- For a video about drum progression, there's no drum progress being shown
- Too much talking, not enough B Roll. Feels like a video essay
- Not enough showing, everything is just telling
- Unnecessary scenes, or at least it can all be minimized. Cut out more
Things I like:
- lighting is generally good
- Emotional parts are genuinely emotional
- Music choices are good
- Good editing for each scene

One way to understand how different grooves impact energy is to
1. Create a habit of being aware of energy levels, listening to yourself as much as you play and feeling what the audience feels
2. Record performance with solo tracks against different grooves and compare how they impact

What I know about insurance:
- Dental starts coverage October 1
- Vision is already covered, exam, lenses, and frames are covered up to $120 with $20 for exam and $20 for lenses. Full udate is only $160 then
- Going back to Terry Kang October 1 as well

IM SO FUCKING ANNOYED RIGHT NOW!

Secret to the dead stick technique is not to force it down, but instead to have a loose grip on the stick. Not rebounding with it in the traditional sense but instead forcing against it

Customer told me that my tone and excitement were refreshing and brightened her day. I think

My difficulty with conflict/negotiation is I go in expecting my solution to be met with praise or even just expecting what I ask to happen. How can I begin approaching it from a place of I guess mutual respect and looking for understanding? Maybe approach with curiosity? Like say this is the problem, the emotional context, the solution I've come up with but come in trying to understand their side of it?

It's been a great day off. Need another, but I am starting to feel more recharged. One thing I'm noticing tho is that the best way to recharge is akin to what I did during vacation. Not video gaming, but meandering and pondering. That's how to make it the most meaningful.

Part of resistance to healthy eating is delusional belief that it's unsatiating and if I'm sickly starved that the only antidote is shitty food

What are all the ways to compare jazz drummer's comping patterns? Like if we treat it like a systematic review akin to coffee tasting, what is the criteria?

I think a big part of fixing this issue is trying to understand once again what I'm actually trying to learn from comping. Create a higher clarity there

The really cool part about the video I just took is I FINALLY got an insanely good timing on part of it. Other parts not so much, but it was amazing being able to watch myself and feel that locked in. It's coming together, but it's making me realize the importance of recording and listening, which seem to be the parts I have the most trouble with

Need to repair. It's the same loop as always, spotting it this time though. Spotting the burn out. Need to do something different. Main issue right now is sleep, derived from routine but also derived from rushing, which comes from packing too much in. Steps to repair:
- Limit caffeine, switch to tea today
- Stay on diet and on budget. Eat lots of protein
- Get good sleep tonight and tomorrow
- Give grace
Main fear comes from not having worked out enough, practiced enough, meditated enough, while also having no room for a break. Neglects to take into account I was sick on Monday and the better half of Tuesday, and out of routine for the rest of the week. So I'm demotivated from doing all these things because some part of my mind, the one avoiding the present, says "what's the point? I have missed so much already." Don't worry about what we missed. Start over today. We can do this! Sit and feel the pain if you have to. Feel frustrated but don't be frustrated. Don't be frustrated about your resentment towards your parents. You're still working through stuff and haven't had enough time to actually process all the emotions you're dealing with. It's okay Zach, I love you and I will take care of you.

Use the infinite sales technique when meeting new people. Set up a meeting with them, coffee or food, run sales, and if they don't take up on it ask them for other sources

Really need to just brainstorm how I can incorporate all these things in my life

I think what's really going to change my diet is just learning more about it. Like difference between the carbs and foods and when to eat them. Be more intentional about it and not just shove shit down my throat 

It's so much scarier holding eye contact with a cute girl than anyone else. Idk why. Almost like a non-belonging thing? There's this girl sat across from me--I think college aged but honestly could be younger. I like how she's dressed. She looks studious. I'm admiring her, not in a way that like it's sexualizing her, but just that she looks nice. I'm trying to humanize her more. But while I was looking, she almost made eye contact with me, and my heart skipped a beat. And i just wonder, why? I like her shoes a lot. It's like a pink version of those adidas everyone wears now. I wish I could afford better shoes.

Big inefficiency in my life is reasoning with myself why I think I have to do everything alone, or why everything is "better" alone. Like what's the causality in getting coffee with a friend instead of alone? This beautiful red head just talked to me in the parking lot(to tell me a spot wasn't available), why is there so much pressure on asking her to get a coffee with me? On even just asking her name? I looked her in the eye so that's progress, but still.

All I had to eat was sweet potato, vegetable medley, and protein shake. I'm excessively full but hardly ate anything
