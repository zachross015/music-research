Afraid to not be myself at all around these group of dudes and be shamed for being non alcoholic, hated for it, and non drug

Caffeine makes it so hard to be mindful and act with intention, I'm always on the edge of the present right now. Also way over caffeinated. But also I think the caffeine just made it easy to numb it all. What actually helped was just sitting and visualizing everything I wished I could say to my dad

I actually feel like I would really like living in New York, but it would be better if it was surrounded by mountains. I guess that's just Seattle though

With caffeine I do fall into a lot of heedless behaviors. 

Caffeine silences Her

Every numbing agent also numbs Her

Feeling very self conscious and afraid right now. Also starving, caffeine crashing, and thirsty. Lacking confidence. I wanna die. Strong desire to be social that I'm constantly disappointed in myself with.
- Anxious about looking like a fool carrying my luggage around New York
- Worried I'll get robbed
- Worried I won't overcome this desire
- Annoyed it's here in the first place
- What if I run into Her? What if she thinks I'm stalking Her?

I know at this point the social thing has just become an inescapable desire. I just don't know how to deal with that. The glamours are:
- Talk to everyone. Constantly entertained. Mind numbed by other people
- Selling more by networking more
- Constantly open
- Always happy because I'm always connected 
- I am "free" wherever I go because I don't need a specific person to start a conversation with
- Never feel alone or lonely because everyone is my people
- No need for walls
- No anxiety in communication or connection
- Always a new opportunity 
- More friends, and better friends
The fears are:
- terrified they'll lash out at me
- They'll kill me
- they'll hurt me
- They'll rob me
- They'll go after my family next
- They're toxic and a poison to my life
- They're better than me and they'll hate me for being so small
- I'll be egotistical 
- I'll be mean and aggressive and I'll be perceived as being a shitty person by a stranger which says more than if I'm seen as shitty by a friend
The reality:
- idk

I'm gonna talk to ChatGPT but only to get ideas. I realize this is something I need to dig deeper on

I'm actually doing it right now. Studying jazz on a plane. That's the immersion I'm looking for!! Still out of my comfort zone so I keep trying to like get out but this is good, I'll be really proud having started the day this way #progress

What about a metronome phone guessing game for getting better tempo? #ideas #apps

Note for next time: find somewhere else to park. Can't afford this $20/day shit

Sometimes I need the fear or disappointment to act

To get more people on drums, make it as convenient and glamorous as guitar

Intentions for tomorrow at the airport:
- 1 40 minute meditation 
- Study Parisian for at least 30 min
- Study Daahoud for at least 30 min
- Start transcribing next song on paper

I think the thing with eye contact is it's not about trying to force it back or use it to pivot into an interaction but just genuinely looking at things with a sense of awe and wonder and curiosity, looking for things. What is even the point of stranger eye contact outside of that? Like in looking at someone, why else do we hold eye contact? What other intentions are there? Resistance to it is combo of avoidance and parents teaching not to stare. Part of ending conversation before it starts

Alex, Shelbea's friend, really inspires me. I keep thinking about her in building better boundaries around others

The next social step is just hold eye contact and wave if they keep watching. The trick is to stop fearing that they'll look at me or changing my reaction so that alone doesn't make me look away and just admire what I admire. Next level is start a conversation with a stranger. Next is to bring in two strangers. Get over this resistance at the beginnning to just initiating. We're already good at holding one, just not starting. I think the actual fear is less that they'll look at me as much as just not wanting to be a creep

Drum challenge would be to replicate rap songs as drum solos. Like split the acoustic instruments between limbs and use the lyric line as the solo line #drums #challenges

Shopping in DT NYC is weird. It's this like constant reminder that we are under the desperate urge to constantly reinvent ourselves #highthoughts but also the level of purity I want to be able to afford

I'm starting to appreciate every genre of music so much better #progress

Befriending Connor is this evidence that I'm capable of befriending everyone now without shrinking myself or having to agree with them. My confidence is getting strong enough to be myself even in big groups, slowly but surely #evidence I feel like I'm starting to be able to stay with that vision of Her and Him even under pressure to "perform"

I think being here is showing me I've never really been like truly comfortable around a group of guys. Part of the issue? Always tried to fit it but now I'm trying to make space to be myself and make choices as myself instead of falling into them

Trying to find the middle ground and I don't understand it

They're all surprisingly accepting of my sobriety. It's funny too because they keep trying to pin the sleepiness on me. And I almost feel glad and strong for taking the blame here knowing I can handle it

This whole trip is showing me both how much I've grown socially and how much room I still have to grow. Things are definitely getting better and easier and more confident, and my dreams are somewhat changing. But all in all I'm loving a lot of the progress and especially getting to hang out with new people and feel more connected to Him, feeling like I belong with a group of dudes for once. Just wish I weighed less. I talked to a lot of strangers today, made it a goal to say "go Mets" to at least 5 people at the game, only did 3 in the end but that's more than I would've done. Can envision a version of myself who just talks to strangers and is known for it and I love that. The beauty of life. The value of money. Where I want to be and be able to afford to love myself more. Other ways to increase confidence with these things. Just hoping it's not a secular thing. Talking to girls etc

There's such a feeling of like peace and comfort at sports games. Like it takes your mind off everything else. Same with concerts. That's what I'm doing for people. What I do helps people to enjoy life to the fullest

I've been challenging myself to talk to strangers at this ball game and look around with admiration. So far, said Go Mets to 3 strangers, faced one big rejection. This is the kind of social risking I want to keep taking on. The kind of rejection I feel like I'm starting to get strong enough to face #progresss

It's hard to start conversations with strangers when I won't even do it with friends or acquaintances. Should start there first, building enough inner security to just feel comfortable with what I'm saying in general

I flirted with a girl tonight!!!! More tomorrow

They're both sitting on the subway, seats apart and on other sides. Her head is down in Her book when she feels someone watching. She looks up to see Him, admiring Her as if she was Athena Herself. He belongs there. His soft face relaxes into a smile. She won't break his gaze. He's calm. Her cheeks flush. It feels like they'd been staring into each other's souls for an eternity. He looks Her up and down again before looking away, holding his smile. She's stunned.

The image is of the end, she's staring at him with red cheeks and a shocked look on Her face. He's staring down at something, with the corner of His smile Peeking out

Evan's friends have done such a great job of including me AND focusing on experience over wealth. 

Outfit right now is missing belt, necklace, bucket hat, and wrist accessory ohh and tank top
