Trying to get back to that place of unjudgemental observation, but finding it hard. Selvi is talking a lot about money and because of my insecurities I'm finding it hard to distinguish my Self from her opinions

What does "whatever it takes" look like to Jesse's glow offer
- find musicians, no specificity to who they are, and get them to fill in the parts

What it means to do whatever it takes to get my shift covered:
- Post offering
- Message each person individually. Ask them if they're looking for hours and ask them to trade. If they say no, offer to trade Wednesday
This is how we build trust. Doing whatever it takes.

I'm starting to feel like the problem isn't the fact that… That the problem is that I don't believe in the kind of future I want to create enough so I'm having to conceptualize other ways of achieving what I wanna do. Like I think I know I want to be a performer a writer, a creator and the conflict I have is trying to figure out how I'm gonna scale that kind of a practice indefinitely. Maybe it's not that I need to scale it in definitely but I need to have a conceptual idea of a reality where that can work you know where I can gig I can perform. I can create new things with whoever I want whatever I want without it being connected to any kind of a limitation on what I currently know. I don't think I can visualize being a good teacher because I've never done well with teachers. I've always done well by finding the materials on my own and learning my own and so I think I have a better time providing for people that are similar to that. In the words of what Seth Goan would say I don't trust myself to be a great teacher, but I do provide trust myself to be a great learner and a great sharer. And maybe packaged that information in a way that other people can learn on their own.

And I feel like I'm stuck in this position now of not knowing at all what to do or maybe it's that I know what to do and I'm having a hard time with it. You know like the whole route with teaching doesn't feel right with me and maybe that's just where I'm at right now like I like playing and I like performing I like learning and it's hard to package those into something that I feel like is meaningful to people without them coming specifically for me and right now all of it feels so complicated. Because I guess the things that I want to do now feel so selfish or at least like I've done them for so long and they've grown a little bit but I guess it feels like there's a better way. You know like I think of playing gigs and recording and like I've been picking up more stuff and I think the people been getting better and I'm getting paid for it now but it's still so slow and it's like what what's the focus right now?

Intentions:
- Eat 1030
- Walk Mu 11
- Run 1230
- mental health 1330
- Planning 1420
- Pic up Selvi 1700
	- Listen to jazz way down
- Groceries/cooking 1900

Feel this deep sense of love and attraction since my dream last night

I keep thinking about the dream I had with work Jess last night. We were working together, cooking together, And she was all over me. _We got naked and almost had sex, but I was so stressed about the job that I wouldn't commit to her._ Then, the whole situation became a repeat of Amy, her telling me how in love with me she'd been. 

And I'm just realizing now how much of a reflection this is of my priorities in life. So stressed about the job that I miss the opportunities right in front of me.

Too much discomfort around being disliked

Incompletion has eroded my sense of self trust, and also falling to fear and not sticking up for myself when someone has hurt me. This is why things like starting a business and playing with better players has been so difficult. Then also, unwillingness to give/recieve->unwillingness to ask. I notice this today, having difficulty asserting to Zoe that her calling out has hurt me, but a lot of my justification is that I don't have the generosity to compensate or that I have trouble with being disliked here

Terrified of the residual discomfort that comes from standing up for myself and others. Ironically, I think it's the mindset of "I can't say something" that perpetuates the idea that once something is said, that I couldn't find any way back to comfort. It's also based on the assumption that this kind of conversation needs to be difficult and quick, but it doesn't always need to be that way. Could just be a case of, you calling out is causing x problem, how can we work together to fix this?

I feel like something I encounter a lot when dealing with certain identities (eg the ungenerous) is that when they're uncovered, I embody them fully, and every all of the spiritual energy of that emotion becomes me. Like if the energy of it is stuck in a depression, then I become stuck in a depression. That's where I feel like I am right now, and some part of me is trying to compensate with the usual dopamine triggers. But I just woke up from this major sugar crash that lasted like 3.5 hours and has cost me so much time. And every thing else feels so numb in comparison.

Drum re-harmonizations

I think I actually what was happening today was I was panicking about the numbness instead of just accepting it so I was kind of like looking for some stimulation to bring me out of it. Sometimes it feels like that's a lot of the problem. There are times where I feel nothing because I feel nothing I go to like social media really Pinterest or YouTube or something till I kind of get a stimulus going and I think it's just another place. We're self trust is lacking. Because it's like if I trusted that it was temporary or didn't go away and that the real solution would be something like working out or walking or even journaling then it wouldn't have lasted so long or even been like an issue in the first place they would've just been like OK this is what we're dealing with. Let's let it be here while we do other things

I can start to see why marketing works on a bigger scale because if you have a blueprint for who something works for an ideal, you could just pop another version of the same exact system down somewhere else

What are the intentions for today?
- Explore
- Get food for lunches
- Practice 2hrs kitless 
	- Some left hand exercises? Which ones? I feel like I'm disproportionately focused on right hand
	- speed on pad
	- Transcribing
	- Listening
- Exercise
- Make food

I'm sitting here in Read it Again books, and it's one of those synchronicity moments. There was a seat right next to the book "Can't Hurt Me." It's been a book I've been longing to read. Even the first couple pages in, I'm thinking to myself that what if all I'm feeling is the discomfort of being outside the comfort zone? What if all I'm looking for is comfort? I feel like the burn out is real, but there may also just be be this element of self pity. I think there's truth to not knowing what I want or where I'm going with it, but there's also a level of tha pity.

Now it starts to seem apparent that asking is hard not because I can't offer anything, but because I won't. If I got to a point where I was already over giving, where I trusted myself and gained the trust of others to overpay and share the treasures, then asking for favors like recording and such would be so simple. Like for instance, if others trusted that by helping me the return would be way greater than the work they put in, it would be more obvious to just help. But gaining that level of trust or even confidence in myself to be that giving would mean from the start being stupid generous 

I think the kind of leverage I've been trying to get in the meantime has been a combination of money and acclaim, but I fear I've already lost the trust of a lot of the people I seeve

Acoustic drums and cymbals sound so much fucking better for reels content 

Need to build self trust by doing "whatever it takes" more often but in a way that isn't self sacrificing, recognizing and fully committing to it. Or maybe it's not self sacrificing if it's whatever it takes to make the world the way I want and helping people along the way. But practicing generosity with it is the most important

Feel a lot better after hike yesterday. I feel like a lot of the drainage from Starbucks is really just Kendall. Julian comes in and exemplifies leadership in such an inspiring way. He does the work, but with this calm demeanor that emanates "We Can Do This!" Much more reminiscent of Jaida and the kind of leader I want to be.

I wonder if seasonal depression isn't just a byproduct of burnout

There are ways to "leak" the value of currency where no one benefits, but the only example I know is in digital marketplaces. Like with the whole CSGO gun skin thing...who profited off of the influx of product? Is that just millions of dollars lost? Especially when the product didn't require any actual labor? Or does it all go back to the company? I guess they had to buy all the guns in the first place. Idk. But I'm beginning to see the value of money outside of the ways I've villainized it. It's weird, it's like it can be--I'm going to say it in the most direct way possible but I think there's a better way to view it--taken from neighboring tribes to better fuel your tribe. Or even pooled from your own tribe to give more to them. And I think there's problems I have with money stem from 1) I always view it as taking from someone else and 2) I always view it as selfish and selfish = bad. But what if I'm poking into a currency flow in a way that provides for the people I care about? What if I'm doing it in a way that makes more value for the people in my tribe?

Being more generous = getting lucky more often

I feel like one part of being myself everywhere means bringing habits with me too. Staying true to myself in that way? Like running and drumming even out of town.  It I also think an important part of recovering from burnout is taking a long enough break to recover the willpower for enforcing these habits.

One thing I've thought about a lot recently is the role other people play in everything I've been learning. Like I think I've worried a lot about the ways other people think about me? Maybe too much? Trying to understand cultivating generosity from a perspective of achieving my own goals feels strange. And it's like this big exercise of trust. Because the way I see it, nothing in the world except for what I want matters. That's not the best way of phrasing it, but the gist is I see things solipsistically. BUT I care deeply about other people and the impact I have on the world. And I think what I'm struggling with is admitting that. Admitting that I am selfish. That I care, but I care much more about achieving what I want to achieve than anything else, and am willing to sacrifice a lot to get there. What more is generosity than a tool to get there? There's a lot more to explore here.

Just read this line from an earlier journal to Jess:
> because I wished I could’ve loved myself even a fraction as much as I’d loved you.
That one hits hard, even when it wouldn't be true anymore.

I had a rough ride down today. Maybe not as much rough as it was weird? The thing that's been on my mind has been the government shut down, and it's caused this blanket of fear to wash over me. The part of it that's preoccupied my mind has been a premonition that society might break down. But the weird part of it is like...I don't think I'm in any immediate danger. I also don't think any of it really impacts me. But I'm scared? And I know from whatever emotional work I've tended to that it means there's latent fears from something else present. So instead of running away, I indulged the fears and observed them. It was interesting, my body guided me back to Haley again through a really roundabout method. It brought up Dream Theater, then Daybreak, then Leprous, which led me to Distant Bells and At The Bottom. Maybe not just Haley, but both the breakups. It also took me to those old journal entries. I'm still not sure how it all connects. My best guess is that the reason I'm so cautious right now and worried about acting selfish is because that's where I ended up before? Or maybe not that. Maybe it's the savior complex stuff. Like in terms of all the political problems going on, the part of me being activated is the savior? But the savior who has no control over the situation? I don't really understand it. Like I'm absolutely mortified at the idea of ending up back where I was at the end of either break up. And reading back on those journals...there's so much worrying about what they thought. Almost no tending to what I thought or felt. I could see where things started to change. But I can't get there again. I still remember the pain, and I would do anything to prevent that from ever happening again. But I'm still facing the trauma from both of them, and clearly haven't forgiven either of them or myself. And I think what's stopping me from advancing to this next step is the fear that I could end up back there. At the bottom grabbing for a handle. Not just in drumming, but in relationships and work. Like those things had stunted my growth. I think I'm als worried because right now it's been hard visualizing the role of mental health work in my future even when it's been such a critical role in how I've gotten here. Almost like deviating from being liked by everyone is grounds to send me right back to the bottom, as if I've learned that from experience. I feel like there's a lot more to dig into here, but I can certainly tell that the fear is surrounding how much I feel the need to control what people think about me, and how my status is determined by a level of comfort with how I appear to everyone.

It almost seems like generosity is an exercise of trust. Or everything is. Like...idk. It feels weird that the more in tune to your own needs, desires, and objectives you become, the less other people's emotions seem to play into it all. All I've begun to understand is it's literally impossible to guess or understand how someone else may respond to something. Trying to anticipate seems pointless. Trying to shape any one else's thoughts seems pointless. And like the only legitimate path to growth seems to revolve around acknowledging these facts and committing to yourself anyways. Asking for things, taking risks, standing up for yourself, and trusting others to do the same for themselves. I don't think I'm explaining it well enough, but it's like thispositivekind of selfishness.

And the part that's having a hard time shifting in my mind is generosity and the purpose of skillsets involving others. Like I think I've for the longest time approached generosity with an intent to gain something. Reshaping that and art and I think other things in the same vein in terms of a newer definition perplexes me
