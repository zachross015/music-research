I'm starting to think that I'm making excuses for not getting to New York or LA or Nashville and so I feel like I need to make a list of essentially tasks that would prove to myself that I'm capable of making it when I'm there

You either have to have short term or long term discomfort. Most of the time you get to decide. You can survive on milk and cookies if you don't mind the acid reflux. You can workout everyday or be overweight. You can follow someone else's path or deal with the resistances that arise from taking the road less travelled. #blog

Daily blog is meant for people behind me on the journey. Short cutting their path.

Still full from the chili last night. It's crazy how much a difference in Whole Foods makes

Giving the gift of music also means giving the gift of playing music

# 11-26-2025

Starting to see that the most direct route to mastery that keeps you in that state of discomfort is learning someone else's music at least once a month. So like a good system around this
- transcribe one full song a month
- learn fully one song a month
- Use that song to find gaps and zone in on them
- Maybe also learning new solos for frequently

Been uncovering more of the kink stuff around being small or used. Like in thinking about Ariana Grande, I'm able to get into contact with the muse again and ask some questions. I ask "why am I so afraid of you?" And she says "because I am you. I know you. I know how to hurt you in the worst ways imaginable, and you trust me not to. At any point I could decide to turn on you, to betray you, to drop you, to leave you for someone else, to abandon you, and I don't because I love you. But the option is always there." At which point I realize, I feel so undeserving of Her love. I think I like the fantasy of being used, objectified, rode, manipulated, and being small because then I belong to Her. She can't abandon me. It's a false safety in a way. Even if she's doing something with someone else, she keeps me close by. She does it because of me, for me.  But the idea of her being separate from me, out of my control, feels almost devastating. So I need her to take control of me. To make me into what She wants me to be. To use me in a way that makes me indispensable. Because I'm not good enough to earn it for real. Even her assurance and affirmation feels like her power over me. 

Like when she looks at me, it feels like she's looking through me. She says things like I'm so glad you're mine or I can't believe you're all mine. Or mommy needs this. She like provides reassurance as while, kissing my neck in my cheek like I can tell. She's only coming to me because she's horny. It's something about that. Also makes me feel that way. Like it surprises me when she does things for me otherwise when she even thinks about me. And I guess that's why I feel so insecure about it because it seems like she only wants to pay attention to me or at least I only think about her paying attention to me when she needs me like that. The funny thing is I remember this being the case with Jess or even Calista too. Like I felt really undeserving and like I was constantly failing them and I feel like in some way it was to re-create that fantasy to feel like or to make it feel like they needed me by starving them until they would just take it.

Like the current fantasy: She's on top of me and I'm still clothed but she's naked. We're having this conversation. I feel so much doubt, insecurity. And she's saying everything I wrote out earlier. But she's never looking me in the eye. She keeps kissing. Nothing in her voice hints at remorse, more like she's just taking what belongs to her. Like I'm nothing and she's everything. She eventually pulls my pants down and starts riding me. Getting her fill. But she never really makes eye contact. 

And there's alternate versions where she tells me how much she loves me. Where she can't take her eyes off of me. I like those better, but the feeling is the same. Doubt, insecurity. Not necessarily love so much as like surrender to Her. It's an improvement but I think I want something deeper, something with more security. Belonging without possession.

Atiira and Kaylen said things are different at work when I'm not around. A completely different vibe, like more isolated. It makes me feel good knowing that my energy is already beginning to carry that kind of weight to it, that it's not just wasted effort. My presence makes a difference. That and teaching have made me think a lot about my role as a leader and as a teacher. I'm trying to be someone who makes risk taking and failure feel safe. Like everything is a learning opportunity when you let it be, and that by cultivating that energy for myself I'm cultivating it for everyone else too.

Gratitudes:
- Kaylen for showing up on time
- Brandi for taking such an interest in my life and holding me accountable to our friendship
- Kendall for trusting me
- Jason for commenting on all my drum stuff
- Jackson for doing the same and including me in his projects
