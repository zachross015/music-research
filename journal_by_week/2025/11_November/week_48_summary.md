# Week 48

Started this week on a much higher note than any of the previous ones. I set up the drums for recording, and set to make a plan for the week built on genuine intentions rather than half assed structures. In writing, I also began realizing the core problems which have surfaced from the fallout. Those being
1. my lack of structure being symbolically tantamount to a house of cards built with half finished walls,
2. my habits around generosity reflected in my family (eg I hardly take Mu to the dog park because they hardly do it),
3. the "selfish" nature evolved from how little I think about other people, and
4. almost all of my social issues (dating, joining communities, starting teaching, booking gigs) evolve from the same antisocial behaviors that have plagued me for years.
Continuing into Thanksgiving, I began realizing that delving head first into a single category of music business was not what I wanted, and instead wanted an umbrella organization for managing an Artist's career, mine being the first of the fold. 

Doing so sent me back into another spiral. Amidst my family at Thanksgiving, I grew envious of my family. Getting to see them all married and having kids...I was filled with jealousy and felt ashamed of the life I had been living. I've known that I want a family and kids, but seeing where I am now with the ruins I sit in compared against the "happy" families they have makes me feel behind where I'm meant to be by now. Explaining what I do now to family has also been a treacherous journey in the crevices of my mind where I can't come up with any logical coagulation where all the branches seem to mix together. This was the first sign that I'd been spreading my path too thin in the mean time. Seeing this reinforced that everything I've been doing so far hasn't been working and that change needs to happen if I am to continue growing. In addition, I need more in my bucket if I want to give more.

On a brighter note, my habits feel fully intertwined to the point that I hardly need to plan them. Things like meditation, working out, practicing, planning, and prioritizing healthier foods has become second nature. It's a structure I can finally settle into. Trusting myself to continue with these, I feel like I can let go of them from my mind and begin working on the next part of this foundation.
