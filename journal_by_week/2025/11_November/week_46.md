It's really reassuring going back and watching videos from like a couple days ago on the beach in Savannah talking about my experience playing out there. And I think it's because hearing myself talk about things like music and my love for it and getting to play with people and all that kind of stuff something about it feels reassuring like even when I'm in a state of apathy or depression debt there is still some part of me choosing to do the things I love to do and that there's still some part of me feeling that level of gratitude. It's like when they talk about how you're falling to the level of your habits, it's really heartwarming, knowing that the habits I have now continue to reflect the person I want to be in moments where I don't feel like that person. Like in the video, I talk a lot about service to other people which is still something that I'm struggling to comprehend in a major way, but hearing myself talk about it from that perspective gives me hope that even when I don't feel great I'm still working towards that.

it's really heartwarming, knowing that the habits I have now continue to reflect the person I want to be in moments where I don't feel like that person.
