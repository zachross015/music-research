# Week 47

This week was another of trials. I was caught up with indecision at the path forward. Should I teach lessons, manage performances, or commit to online work? I've realized that cutting out during the fall and winter is the critical part of growth, yet this decision left me feeling tumultuous. Possibly the best quote that's come from this: "I HAVE to still practice. I have to trust that no matter what I choose, mastery is still my core focus, and that I will always do so while staying curious." 

My own unreliability has once again begun being highlighted in my mind as the source of my own distrust. It infects my ability to complete a plan just as much as it does working with habits on a day to day basis, and I've begun believing this to be one of the biggest energy drains in my life. Almost like there's a constant wear down of having to check off the things I would do as a result of habit rather than settling into them as a constant structure. It would be like if I built a house to spec and still checked the walls everyday. 

The conditioned worsened throughout the week. A slow decline that resulted in physical illness by Friday. It made me sit with the turbulence and write about it, but more honestly. And the conclusion I came to was this combination of indecision, feeling both like I had to take all control and leave nothing up to chance while also feeling like I had no control, frustration over continuing struggling with community issues, and nostalgia over how simple things were when I started this journey.

From there, I spent Saturday recovering. I woke up and focused only on drums. Transcribed. Hooked up my kit with mics. Played a gig. Cleaned everything. These are the things that returned me home.

## Achievements

1. Set my kit up with a proper home recording setup
2. Starting working to setup gigs with Jalen
3. Confronted Zoe about a disrespectful situation.

## Friction

- Not completing anything
- Still haven't worked to find a community
- Building plans day to day without any strategic long term plan leaves too much up to chance and feels entirely structureless
- Lack of trust in self from lack of completion
- Too much to do, not enough time
- Scatter brained prioritization
- I don't know if this is true, but possibly trying to do too many big thigns at once. eg marathon training while trying to grow a business while trying to become a master drummer while also trying to be enlightened. It feels like too much 
- Not thinking about other people enough
- Lack of long term goals makes it harder to prioritize things in the day to day
- Lack of trust in long term commitment makes it hard to stay disciplined
- Lack of trust in long term goals might be because I'm the one setting the goals instead of someone much further ahead that knows better (eg Runna)
- Didn't complete 

## The ONE Thing

Completion. Taking on tasks and not seeing them through. It's threefold.
1. Unrealistic goal setting from the offset, not taking into account obstacles and not setting intentions.
2. Lack of long term structure that the goal contributes to.
3. Lack of perserverance.
How do we resolve this?

I think in one part, things can be batched more because drum stuff has more of a structure. So like a week can be dedicated to transcribing, another one to learning. That way there's less switching.

## Goals

1. Come up with business structure for business.
2. Learn 0.5 of song.
