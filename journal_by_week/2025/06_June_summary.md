# June: The Breakdown That Revealed Her

June was a month of unraveling. I began in fight-or-flight, grieving Andy and Jaida, sleepless, obsessed with Brandi’s mixed signals, and spiraling into manipulation and eroticized pain just to feel something. When the deeper wound—attachment severed at birth—finally surfaced, my body collapsed under the weight of it, leaving me shaking, raw, and broken for days. I clung to Brandi even more, desperate for connection, but each encounter only deepened the ache. I couldn’t speak my truth, trapped in silence like I’d been as a child, and the shame of never being heard made even friendship unbearable. I felt abandoned by God, by Him, by everything steady. But on vacation, I threw my phone behind a bookshelf and finally found stillness—met Her fully, reconnected with my family, and remembered who I was. I saw how I’d glamorized unsafe love, mistaking chaos for passion, and used my family's joy as something to sell rather than to live in. Coming back, I didn’t want Brandi anymore—I wanted peace. I ended the month more centered, having disentangled Her from Brandi, the Siren from fantasy, and felt—for the first time in a long time—like I was finally home in myself.

## Achievements

1. Found Her and detached Her/Siren from Brandi
2. Became strong enough to pick up another student and start being paid for gigs
3. Planned my first camping trip
4. Recognized the need to detach from the world to recover

## Friction

Most of the friction from this month revolved around attachment issues. The obsessive quality of them, that I hope has been fixed, drove me to lose myself completely. I stopped wanting to practice, grow my business, eat, sleep, work on myself, etc. 

## Goals for next month

1. Finish running rehab on Runna
2. Transcribe 33 songs(solos) for drums
3. Earn $1000 from drums and get walls/floors figured out.
