I feel like a really cool business plan should and growth should revolve around some initial habits:
- Daily posting on tiktok (in a way that I could be proud of)
- Weekly blog/newsletter (collected as a summary from journals, what resistance is there)
Need to get over resistance to more long term solutions, such as redundant catchphrases or content consistency. 

Timeline:
- Phase 1: Start independent business and learn to trust yourself to fly.
    - Get 15 students at $50/hour. Do whatever it takes. Post fliers first. Talk with people. Cold call. Cold email. Book lunches with producers, players, etc. Jam sessions. Let everyone know you're taking students. Be selfish. Become comfortable with onboarding. Write down what works.
    - Weekly gig schedule.
    - Form an LLC.
- Phase 2: Grow online presence. Intention is to attract higher quality students, people willing to pay more, but also expand out of the local network and make work sustainable anywhere.
  - Habitualize TikTok (daily post for 66 days straight).
  - Habitualize Newsletter (weekly post for 10 weeks straight).
  - Habitualize Blog (weekly post for 10 weeks straight).
  - Quarterly YT update
- Phase 3: Move and start over.
  - Do phase 1 but somewhere else starting at $75/hr instead, with an option for online.
  - Find Monetizable product strategy
- Phase 4: Expand.
  - Start group classes. 
  - Hire another teacher.


  Good question. A content plan can easily become overwhelming if you try to make it too detailed or rigid. To minimize the amount of time it takes, you can strip it down to the essentials that actually move the needle and automate/reuse as much as possible. Here are some ways:

### 1. Start With a **Simple Framework**

* **Pillars:** Pick 3–4 broad themes you’ll post about (e.g. *drumming technique, performance stories, student success, mindset*).
* **Formats:** Decide 2–3 types of content you’ll make (e.g. short-form video, newsletter, blog).
* **Frequency:** Pick a cadence you can *actually* keep up with (e.g. 2 reels + 1 newsletter per week).

This prevents decision fatigue and keeps the scope small.

### 2. Use a **Content Matrix**

Take each pillar and pair it with each format. That gives you a plug-and-play set of ideas. For example:

* **Technique × Reel** = Quick tip demonstration
* **Mindset × Newsletter** = Reflection about practice discipline
* **Performance Story × Blog** = Recap of a gig

You don’t have to brainstorm from scratch every week.

### 3. Batch the Work

* **Brainstorm once a month** → list 8–12 ideas in one sitting.
* **Create once a week** → film/write a small batch in 1–2 hours.
* **Schedule once** → queue them in a scheduling tool.

This turns “daily decisions” into a single block of time.

### 4. Repurpose Aggressively

One piece = multiple uses:

* A **video tip** → captioned reel → transcript → newsletter blurb → tweet.
* A **long-form blog** → chopped into 3 posts + email.
  You’re multiplying output without multiplying effort.

### 5. Lower the Bar for Quality

* Aim for **consistent, good-enough** content, not polished masterpieces.
* Use **templates** for graphics, captions, and hooks.
* Reuse intros/outros instead of reinventing them every time.

The less you start from scratch, the faster it goes.

### 6. Track What Works

Every 4–6 weeks, check: *What got engagement, questions, sign-ups, or leads?*
Drop what flops → double down on what works.
That way, you stop wasting time producing filler.

👉 The “minimal viable content plan” is just:

* **3–4 pillars**
* **2–3 formats**
* **1–2 posts per week**
* **Repurpose + batch**

Everything else is optional polish.

Do you want me to help you design a **time-minimized template** for your drum coaching brand, where you can just slot ideas in instead of rebuilding a plan every time?

ICI (IIC OR CII) framework for self-improvement:
- Consistency
- Intensity
- Intentionality
Would be a good TikTok thing if I could figure out how to package it. Even a 90 day program for drumming

How do I come up with original posts every day for TikTok? 
- Think of it as an art form. Find better ways to communicate different things like insights. Figure out how others do it
How hard would it be to just do a weekly blog/newsletter? I already have the summary idea ready from lessons stuff. Maybe cap it first just to get in the habit.

What do I need to do to treat this more like a business?
- Business models
- Try ANYTHING to grow the business, regardless of fears

Don't lose focus. It may be too early to meet with Tommy. Or is that resistance? I'm more thinking from a time commitment perspective, it would make more sense to focus that time on getting students. Or would it? I have no clue

Post practice routine once a week
- easy way to get follows by offering it as a backup for people who don't want lessons 
- Easy avenue for other videos by describing them 

Book idea: practice inspiration for drummers. Glorified listickle on meta exercises like ostinato, transcription, etc. breakdown the areas it improves (groove, time, etc). Can bake into app
- free excerpt for email list?

Video idea: Music Journey running a marathon
Open on a quote about the first marathon. "Now I may not be a fighter on the ...war, but my marathon journey started with Th Artists Way, leading me down the War of Art leading me to Eat, Pray, Love until I think and grow rich.

...

Now you may be wondering what this all has to do with music. But the biggest constatnt in my life throughout all of this was music. Josh and I connected through Sawyer hill concerts. Florence and I ...

I think the solution to a lot of my resistances right now is to surround myself with people AND resources (ie podcasts, books) which make what I'm doing feel both good and right. Like listening to Good Mythical Morning on the rich roll podcast has made it feel both warranted and necessary to explore financial motives within the scope of creativity, which gives me more energy to push things like lessons in drumming. BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE NOT TO UNDERSCORE THE ONE MOST IMPORTANT THING: THE CRAFT in growing this way.

# 09-16-2025

Why am I not going to sleep now? I'm so fucking exhausted that I can't workout and have no energy to extend practice. All I can do is numb. I'm being hard on myself about trivial shit like reels and prioritizing the wrong things

I think I also care way too much about how people perceive me in reels for something barely any one watches. What's stopping me from A/B testing specific videos, such as this vaudeville jam? And just posting practice routines?

Is there anything wrong with taking what they're doing and just doing it better?

My resistance at this point has little to do with the concept so much as execution. I always resist making the video, even when I'm frequently happy with the outcome, in part because I don't think I recognize the jubilance of having created something. A big part of it is not knowing how to make talking engaging and connecting. But it's also a real possibility that, at the moment, online content is a distraction. Specifically short form. Mainly because it's not what I'm interested in to begin with

Content schedule:
- Sunday: Practice Routine
- Saturday: Seven grooves I came up with this week

Since coming back from this trip, I feel like a new layer of reality has been peeled away. I used to feel energized by the people at work, but today I realized how negative their influence is, but also how much I only connect with them through negativity. Like when telling the story about my trip, I relived more negative details than positive. Talking about Jeff and Jess rather than the beautiful wedding, all the love, and the social connections. But even aside from that, every word that came out of Brandi's mouth was about how hard of a time she was having, Kevin was drama, etc. it's weird how hopeless it feels there now when it used to feel invigorating.

A lot of resistance around contacting Aidan for poster help. Or any graphic designer

Aligns with a separate fear of starting a band, all rooted in trusting other people

Probably a similar resistance to why I'm against a camping trip that Amanda and Brandi are putting together. That one is because I'm not in charge of it in a sense

Build a content matrix, spend everyday researching what I enjoy most in those fields and interacting. It's part hashtag research, part outreach, part video making. Note, don't look at what's addictive, looks at what's fulfilling. That's how I get the most out of social media. Researching what works
- Where does x content live

I think the reason social proof hasn't always worked for me is I'm more of a rebellious mind, an initiator of sorts

Tagline: what are you struggling with today?

So the major things that need to get done:
- Put together offer specifics
	- Need to get into the habit of offloading this because I'm going to need to do it monthly.
	- This is the most effective way to grow the business outside of micromanagement, grow the team as much as I grow the work
- send them to Aidan
- Put together basic content matrix

> For example, many McDonald's restaurants offer a "McFlurry" dessert. When customers in one set of McDonald's were told, "How about a dessert? The McFlurry is our visitors' favorite," McFlurry sales jumped 55 percent. Then after a customer ordered a McFlurry, if the clerk said, "The [x] flavor is our visitors' favorite McFlurry topping," customers increased their extra topping purchases by an additional 48 percent. - Influence, 128

> The key insight is that suppressing true popularity...was unhelpful not only to its immediate profits but also to its' subscribers prudent choices and resultant satisfaction--and, therefore, to the company's long-term profits. - Influence, 129

How can I apply these at Starbucks? And at my career?

Need to be like Matt, get enough social clout to trade favors. These VIP phish tickets are phenomenal

I really need a fucking day off. Just a day to slow down and be with my thoughts. My biggest stress right now is I really want to fucking practice more

The best way to play is to listen more than play. It takes me the same amount of time to lock into a groove as the audience, so channel this fact into diligence. Sit with a groove, don't riff on it for views. Build a story by locking in and trying things intentionally

Think of TikTok like a plant? Feed it with videos once a week then let it grow on its own. Nourishment comes from education, noticing what's working and what isnt

Good way to start noticing potential sales is to just start labeling them

Feel much better now that I ate, sat with my feelings, and am around people. It's cool seeing them growing their art business as well. Gives me inspiration that this will make me fit in more. I think part of my fears is that I'm leaving the tribe in a sense. That by growing, I'm moving away from them. But I think people will appreciate or even just respect me more for it

Emily does clinical research on disorders and general stuff along with an AI thing

I didn't rehearse enough for this gig

Put free lessons in their hands, so if they pre-purchase 12 lessons then they're responsible for handling that

A lot of my resistance comes from including others in my life, specifically allowing them to help or asking them to. With Aidan it's help with posters, with students it's asking them to pay me

All I want to do is eat like shit and cry myself to sleep. This fucking offer is killing me

Devo bio

Really stressed right now because I wanted tomorrow to be a full productive day and instead earliest I'm gonna wake up with full sleep is 9 and I have to go to Athens and fucking miller is here and way too much shit is weighing on me and I have too many fucking impossible expectations for myself and I'm exhausted all I wanna do is sleep fuck Miller

Realizations from tonight:
- Part of social resistance and moving on revolves around not having secure structures (outside of myself) to support my new identities. Like alcoholic, healthy eating, etc. I fall prey to social influence and things fall apart. Need to either strengthen my intentions or find others who align. Because it's so much easier to eat poorly or do drugs when I'm not isolated 
- I stand up for myself a lot more now
- I'm starting to look like the masculine version of who I'm attracted to

# 09-19-2025

Pls for the next two days is to do nothing. But I should still write out the log of resistances/pains to get to a core. It's definitely another burn out, especially with last weekend being the wedding. Need to re-center on what's important though and understand the pains of social growth better, along with how to better manage 

I'm starting to look how I want to look now, how I see myself. It's really cool.

Something seriously wrong to get to the low that I'm at now. I want to say it's a result of negligence to my own schedule saying yes to everything.

How I got good at swing

I wish my response to this lack of energy was to meditate instead of go mindless

I think the fact that I'm more frequently crying in the Starbucks bathroom says something about needing to leave

Notes from Jesse Mangum last night:
- Great left foot technique 
- Great cymbal and crash placement, lots of mindfulness there
- Work on tempo fluctuations 

Motivation returning as exhaustion recedes

# 09-20-2025

And I feel like I'm worrying way too much about what people think about me. Letting their poison infect my mind. Like my nana just said something about how I need to get a job that actually makes money. And that shit hurts and. Is so hard to let go of. Why? I'm too exhausted to understand

# 09-21-2025

Okay I can definitely still feel strong attraction. Cassie is hot as fuck rn. I think i was exhausted. Same with Jess #evidence

What if, just as an experiment, I started posting redundant videos. Even just shitty Jam. What if I let myself grow without putting restrictions on it? Allow myself to be good enough
