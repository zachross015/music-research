ICI (IIC OR CII) framework for self-improvement:
- Consistency
- Intensity
- Intentionality
Would be a good TikTok thing if I could figure out how to package it. Even a 90 day program for drumming

How do I come up with original posts every day for TikTok? 
- Think of it as an art form. Find better ways to communicate different things like insights. Figure out how others do it
How hard would it be to just do a weekly blog/newsletter? I already have the summary idea ready from lessons stuff. Maybe cap it first just to get in the habit.

What do I need to do to treat this more like a business?
- Business models
- Try ANYTHING to grow the business, regardless of fears
