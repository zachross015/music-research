# Week 35: Professional Development

This week was marked by social risk, bravery, a return to meditation, and a departure from numbing. I started off the week in exhaustion. I'd been numb to the growing sense of it until Amanda made a remark, awakening me from my slumber. I took some time to rest. Recovery and consistency were my main priorities during the first two days. My running coach, Runna, also dictated this week as being an off week. So overall the week was spent recovering from all the growth. 

I was pained by the distance between this new evolving version of who I want to be versus the person I am now. I'd begun imagining myself becoming more socially accpeted, beginning to understand the ways in which I've isolated myself out of fears of being perceivied as dumb, too much, not enough, and a pestilence. I allowed those feelings to persist as I helped organize my friends for an open mic night, made plans to practice with SC, attempted to coordinate a jam session with Aidan, and reached out for a dinner with Michael Kralick. My social muscle is still growing however, and these scenarios all created anxiety bursts throughout the days. I continued in spite of them. It feels like it's getting easier to include others in my life, and to be a leader. One of my biggest lessons has been that spreading the word is often enough to create change. All it takes is asking people to come together to bring them together. 

The week ended in Athens, a blissful return to a scene which was once filled with grief. I found myself smiling more, relaxing more. I would hold contact with beautiful people. I held conversations with strangers. I tried to initiate a jam session. I sat with the negative personas that still fill my mom, and daydreamed about what a future could look like where I was succesful. It doesn't feel too far off anymore.

## Achievements

1. Attempted to put together a jam session with SC, then with Aidan
2. Transcribed 2 songs in spite of the resistances I faced to researching them
3. Created minimal offer details
4. Meditated nearly 40 min every day

## Friction

- Social muscle is still weak. I've been trying harder to organize hangouts/meetups/events, yet there's always an associated anxiety. Happened with SC, Aidan, Michael Kralick, etc. Almost like I'm afraid that if I'm assertive enough as my true self, I will scare them off
- Holding others accountable is incredibly uncomfortable
- Not spending enough time sitting and actually writing about jazz. Comparing song to song. Etc. I'm focusing alot on the technical pursuit which is improving, but I think I still would fair poorly in a jazz jam. I really want a jazz jam to be the video finale.
- Vision for long term growth but no concrete plans in place. There is a loose idea but I feel like writing out markers would be beneficial. Like breaking the goal of setting up a gig into milestones? Like a jam? But it also feels like that's just delaying the inevitable. Why not just book a gig and make it work? Why not book more students and make it work? I guess I'm afraid of something like this wedding happening where it's now less then a week before and I have no idea what I'm doing or what needs to be done and *I'm too afraid to look dumb to ask anyone*. This feels like the core problem. Almost an ego thing.
- Not doing enough teaching jazz

Too afraid to look dumb to make any progress.

## Goals

1. Get Wedding ready
2. Finish marketing flier for lessons
3. Resolve studpidity and social anxiety issues
