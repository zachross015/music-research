Getting in Sync training #ideas #business tribal way of synchronizing a team by giving everyone drums and teaching them to play together

The "pestering for accountability" resistance comes from being shamed for being a pestilence, bothering parents when things didn't happen

Organizing a jam is a small step in the way to organizing a gig

I find now that if I have to run a long run, like today I have to do a 12k, that I treat myself better. I eat breakfast and prep meals for before the race. Should do this with all workouts realistically

It went so fucking well and I had nothing to worry about. Even invited me on a backpacking trip. I feel overjoyed honestly, it was so good connecting with the past. Idk why I was ashamed of myself going into it, but getting early enough to sit and sink into the moment really helped. Having a meal gives a chance to slow down and actually talk. And it's like, I can actually trust myself to have a decent conversation. I can allow there to be space without it being awkward. I tried to make more and more space. I forgot to ask what he was listening to.

I wanna be someone who always belongs exactly where he is. Like if I'm sitting outside waiting for someone, I'm doing so presently. Not even anticipating them. Letting them come and go as they please.

Boutta meet up with Kralick. Stupid nervous for some reason. But it's also revealing to me why dates have always felt impossible. Even meeting someone I know I get along with for dinner is fucking terrifying. Would be even more terrifying with someone beautiful

Goal is to become so socially adept that I don't even think about meeting up with people. It just happens. I don't predicate it with a day of anxiety

Starting to lose any concept of time during meditation. In the sense that time becomes meaningless. Nothing "out there" matters when I'm "in here," watching. Like a beautiful escape that exists when I prioritize the meditation 

Can get through social resistance by approaching it as more of a curiosityu

I was anxious going into the wedding stuff, but relaxed coming out. When I look at it, it's the anxiety about being wrong that plagued me.

If I can just put up posters and immediately get 10+ clients...what's stopping me from just doing that anywhere?

What's 30 ideas for jazz videos?

Part of my issue right now with growing the business is completely based on intention. Like I want to help people, but the whole reason I'm really growing is to be on my own again, move out, make more than enough to survive. I keep getting dollar signs for eyes when I think about putting out ads, getting new customers. It's hard because I'm also like...expecting it to work. But what if it doesn't? Ya know like half my plan is banking on the idea that if I actually started to advertise, I'd get clients. But what if I don't? What if nothing trickles in? Then what do I do? I mean obviously try to learn why, revise, and adapt. But part of me is like terrified of that failure

I can take solace in the iteration. I didn't stop at my first video. Or first song. Or first TikTok. First photo. I failed, I got better. I can do it with this.

I don't need to manage her anger. There's nothing special consequence to not saving her. I can't stop her from spreading her negativity, but I can choose not to take part.

Terrified to meet with Michael today. But for the same reason that I'm afraid to talk to any strangers. There's nothing special about this resistance/anxiety. I think a lot of the fear is around abandoning myself to be liked, even when I don't do that as much anymore.

Russ gave me a chicken nugget and some potatoes. I felt a lot of clarity and energy before eating it. Afterwards, feeling sluggish, stomach hurts, and oily.

30 days of reels could just be what did I wish someone had taught me when I started jazz. Or individual jazz licks. Or top 5 [artist] licks. What's my resistance to more formulaic content? Disingenuous? Slop? Like when Alex Hormozi does it, I pay attention. But I resent drummers for doing it because it feels lazy and sloppy. But maybe that's all social media needs?

Talking with my mom now just makes me so fucking angry half the time. We just had this conversation about dad's weight and alcohol and then about Kelly and I just left it all feeling like unheard. I never feel heard by her. Sometimes it feels like I should just stop fucking trying, like the only way to get her to listen is to fucking melt down. For her to realize that half the shit I was saying was never about her. Like she's always talking about someone else. Someone else's problems. What someone else should be doing. Never fucking acknowledging what she should be doing. Or what she even is doing. It's just all drama. And I need to stop engaging with it. It's also that I get so fucking aggravated by people trying to pawn people off on me. Or really just my mom. People saying I should take x or y camping with me. I just can't fucking stand her and she's half the reason I can't survive in a corporate environment. The micromanaging drives me fucking insane.

And the same way that I wanna go backpacking to someone out there and probably a group of people that wanna play drums so it'll be a really good idea to instead of like a weeklong clinic to just do a day long class probably with Drew on getting started with drumming the basics you know explaining everything going over essentials what you need to know it's kind of get into drumming and teach yourself more

What are the things I need to turn around and I idea like this into a prototype within like a week or a month
- 3 hours broke into 50 min increments 
- end with drum circle

Intentions:
- Practice while food settles (1.5hr)
- Exercise (1.5hr)
- Transcribe? 1.5hr
- Poster 1.5hr

Rentable practice rooms, give people opportunities to come during lunch hour or something #business #ideas #musicschool also round table pad practice (technique session) as well as round table drum sessions

I've been feeling so good recently that it's eye opening I feel so bad today. I didn't nap after work or really get a chance to rest, hardly ate, didn't meditate, didn't work out, and played a bunch of video games. The crazy part is like...I realize now just how much my habits differs from this lifestyle. I hated it today, not being able to do anything. Like most days, I can sense this kinda fallout and recuperate, but today I kinda wanted to explore it. And like I'm glad I did, but man it kinda sucked ðŸ˜… like what I'm getting at is that it's weird this is where I started, ya know? Like when I began this journey, this is what life looked like. Sitting alone in the basement, unproductive practice, hardly any exercise or meditation, just playing video games and eating poorly. And like the past couple weeks have been pure diligence, so indulging mindlessness today just made me aware of how far I've come. And I'm really proud of that. I still practiced of course. My head also feels so clear right now, no doubt from meditation. I've been able to detach super easily and be present.

This whole mindset has given me a completely different perspective on drums. Like I was playing along to jam tracks earlier and it hit me that I'm just there to keep time. Or maybe moreso, the other day I was listening to myself play along to the track and got frustrated because I couldn't latch onto anything I was playing. There was no consistency in the groove, just random notes here and there. What hit me today was that I'm meant to keep time so often. It should be like 90% of what I'm doing even when jamming by myself. And to that end, fills or minor changes should be rooted in the groove. On top of that, changes in the groove itself should be done intentionally and simplistically. Like changing the groove by adding more notes, displacing, omitting, orchestrating, etc. all the elements of energy that are present in jazz are present in every genre, and it's about learning how those subtleties are communicated. That's what makes a great drummer

Secret to good art is to enjoy the experience of my own art just as much as someone else would. It's not narcissistic, it's just good art. Bernard Purdie is the best example

Went on a run today even when I was coming down to Savannah. #evidence

A lot of tension, anger, anxiety right now. Frustrated with my mom for whatever reason. Feel like I'm having to mask here. Most likely just exhausted and hungry. Did a good job taking care of myself: separated from the group to eat.

Grief cannot exist without love, and a good way out of resentment is to remind yourself of the impermanence of this all

Cahutta wilderness are

Maybe just always post new grooves? Like with the excitement of "look what I found!" Act as if I'm sharing something cool with the world

I feel weird rn. I see a lot of people crying, but I don't really feel anything. Same with last night. I'm really happy to be here, surrounded by so many lovely people. But I don't feel that same tug everyone else seems to be feeling. Maybe I just don't understand the depths of love the same way they do? I think I'm judging myself for being "apathetic" when I'm not at all. Worried that I'm sociopathic in a way. But I also feel at peace I guess? Like there are emotions but they aren't making themselves known? I can't tell if that's because I'm conditioned to ignore them, or if they just aren't there

Much more confidence about talking about my career.  No sense of shame in it now #progress

Being around other people is just straight up better than being alone. When I settle into myself, I feel so relaxed around others. There's no pressure to be someone I'm not. I laugh more, smile more, experience more. And being around Evan as a business owner is making me be able to vision what life could look like as a business owner. How easy and fun it could be, and how much simpler life could be

It feels like the energy drain I used to have came from doing so much that I didn't want to do just to fit in. When I have the strength to be and stay as myself, I no longer feel drawn towards betraying myself and preserve so much more energy that way. Plus, I feel more joy around my company, and am able to feel a much deeper appreciation and love for the people. Not to mention a deeper feeling of attraction and connection to beauty

A lot of confidence is allowing myself to be too dumb to understand "why" something shouldn't work. Like not allowing comparative aspects (sexiness, beauty, intelligence, skill) to get in the way of progress (eg asking someone out, auditioning for a gig, etc)

The healthier I get and the more in shape/attractive I become, the more I see social growth results. It connects to the stuff in [[Influence]] because of the halo effect around attractiveness. Almost like my shape and condition is part of my social brand on this world. My appearance becomes part of the sale in a sense. Just trying to make sure I'm not using this in a manipulative way. But this includes a lot of how I take care of the world around me. Hygeine, cleanliness, appearance, apparel, diet, etc all contribute

How does physical appearance, diet, apparel, and other more surface level qualities that influence attraction connect to Buddhism? Sometimes I feel like eating healthier, staying in shape, taking care of my body is a confusing grey area for confidence. Like shouldn't I be growing confidence in spite of these things? Or is reducing suffering by being diligent in these qualities a big part of confidence and self-esteem? Because recently I've been seeing more like secular/social progress because of my progress on my confidence, resulting from higher diligence in things like diet, meditation, exercise, and alignment with the things and people I love. But as much as I feel this progress and deepening love for myself, it's hard not to get caught up in the attention I've been receiving for the increased levels of attraction resulting from this increased confidence and diligence. Almost like I'm afraid to have it since it's a lot of responsibility to I guess not abuse.

In short, the answer is to view physical evidence as temporary and see it more as a support for deeper refinement
