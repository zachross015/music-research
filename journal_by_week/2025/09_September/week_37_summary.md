# Week 37

This week was yet another social sprouting. Returning to meditation and all forms of other dilligence has put me into a state of constant calm collectiveness that betrays the emotional extremities I once felt. I feel a greater strength to attend to my dilligences, which I now get lost in. 

I began the week with my first 12k, starting off strong and continuing this effort throughout the week. Due to the growing demand of my physical activities, I've paid greater attention to my fuel sources, opting frequently for the healthy alternatives which keep my mind clear and body at peace. I met with Michael Kralick Tuesday evening and, although I went into the interaction terrified, I left feeling socially rewarded and more confident than ever in my ability to connect. It was a lovely evening where we reconnected on video games, music, and opened the potential for opportunities down the line. This same energy continued throughout the week, where I remained dilligent in spite of time.

Continuing into the weekend was the wedding. It was one of the most socially rewarding experiences. Before arriving in Savannah, I stopped in at Blackbird. I was nostalgic about the past, but I also had so many social encounters. The barista and I talked about Alpharetta. I sat journaling outside and a group of softball players came up and talked to me about it. I was in a conversation with a man there about our jobs. During the wedding, I talked with so many new people and formed great connections. After reception, I went to the bars and talked with Caitlyn (bartender), and at another bar I was complimented heavily by a man telling me how attractive I was. The next day, I wandered around town and yet another group of women came up and talked to me about my journaling. It feels like the more in shape and aligned with my highest self I become, the more others want to connect with me. And lately I've been experiencing this level of social freedom, where I feel I could walk into any room and strike up a conversation with people, where others are willing to hold any conversation with me. It's so rewarding. 

I left this weekend full of love, and a speeding ticket.

## Friction

- The flier still isn't done. My biggest goal right now is not something I'm acting like is my biggest goal. At least not in the cold calling form. I'm doing well communicating and selling I think, but not yet to the people I need to be selling too. More opportunities are arising slowly but surely, yet I need to do a better job setting aside time for the business. There's definitely resistance here, probably in the form of
- Lack of consistency in marketing, mostly due to not knowing how to build a funnel well. No, moreso just lack of consistency from resistances. Using way too many excuses to not build a good funnel and not doing nearly enough review on what works/what doesnt. AKA little improvement

## Goals

- Finish the fucking flier and post it once
- Learn two new Isra songs
- Set up a coffee/lunch with Tommy
