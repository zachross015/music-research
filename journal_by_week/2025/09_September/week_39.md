I picked up my guitar recently, trying to force myself into writing a
happy song. It didn't work. I did the same thing with piano and at
some point I also tried to write a happy poem and none of them ended
up coming out happy I want to be crystal clear that I was in a good
mood. I was feeling great. I was enjoying myself probably after a
meditation or a run our hanging out with my dog for a while and I was
in a good mood, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out why I
didn't know how to write a happy sounding song until I sat on the
drums for those of you that don't know I've been studying jazz for
well over nine months now and part of my practice has revolved
around, listening to new music learning new music and kind of
dissecting. What makes this song feel upbeat. What makes this song
sound joyful what makes it sound sad or calmer relaxed you know any
other emotion you can think of and I think something that I've been
thinking about a lot recently has been the effective genre on are
playing like the vocabulary of genre on our playing and the way that
we're able to communicate emotions now when it comes to stuff like
piano guitar I've only ever learned what I think of as being very
heavy almost melancholic sad music you know I come from metal and the
Reefus I've always stuck with were the ones that I learned from
teenage angst or even college just depressing ties in my life where I
didn't know how to communicate negative emotions so I just ended up
you know, communicating through music and in one way or another, and
I think all of this has led me to this realization of just how much
you know vocabulary shapes our thoughts in our ability to create and
why in creative practice and like diligence to creativity, we have to
learn about other genres other feelings, and really sit with and
understand the emotions that come out of the song, not only
understand them, but be able to practice and play them and re-create
the feeling that comes out and I think all of this explains why I
wasn't ever able to come up with a happy poem or a happy you know
Guitar lick it because all of my music has always been learnt from
all of my diligence in music has kind of come from a place of anger
and sadness to express things that I haven't been able to always
convey to people, and I feel like as I've developed a better language
to communicate negativity to people. I've also learned how to
communicate in other instruments, positivity, almost like kind of
balancing it out, but at the very least, I feel much stronger pull to
communicating things that are happy in art you know things that are
lighter not as darker depressing

Overthinking the website right now. Need to simplify to just being about the specific offer and expand later. Also, a good idea is to create the offer independent of the lessons. Like make lessons a known thing at $75 per lesson, but make the offer about a fixed program of 90 day jam essentials at a discounted rate

Intentions
- Rest (max 2 hours)
- Walk Mu
- Practice 
- Exercise
- Rest

The more I reflect on the problems of the past week, the more it comes down to a couple things:
- Trying to expand the duration/dilligence of every task while simultaneously not having enough time for even the base layer. Like 3+ hour rehearsals and hour long meditations and 1.5 hour runs while also having work and night time activities 
- Trying to escape into dilligence as a means of avoiding feelings or burnout 
- Ego sensitivity to Amanda becoming better than me, or outperforming on tasks which I was previously a top performer, and worrying at the security of my role because of it 
- intensity over consistency 
- Not listening to myself
- Making no room for progress and instead treading
However, I recognized burn out much quicker. The signs were apparent: video gaming, binge eating, masturbating, neglecting habits. There is progress. I think every time I go through this, I both get better at recognizing it and gain more resilience to it. I think I still need more time tbh. But the focus now is get this program up and running.

What do I need to know to leave SBUX?
- Gross sum of what I make here including stock, insurance 
- Cost of insurance outside of

This next phase of my career is all about creating marketable products and services.
- 90 day jam/gig-ready pack
I CAN deliver! I'm good enough. It means fleshing out everything. Coming up with realistic plans or fully putting products together. Putting a genuine effort into the services I give. This has been the missing component. Start with the 90 day program. Then build PDFs. Do blog posts. None of this needs to take a long time. Blog post can take 15 min. TikTok's 2-3. This kind of thing is what I've been the most afraid of. Be genuine and put thought into it, but not too much. Too much thought creates too much resistance, and the longer it sits the worse it gets. Make decisions and make mistakes and learn from them

5 ways I improved my practice routine
- Start with story about the mindless entrance
- 1. Approach with intention 2. Figure out how long it takes to learn something (start with jazz)

Should've connected with that customer

If I just posted free recording on Insta? Would that do anything, it seemed to work for Jesse

4 week sight reading bootcamp

TOMORROW IS BUSINESS DAY. FULL FOCUS SHOULD BE ON BUSINESS

- I gain trust with companies that possibly post about success stories. It makes me lean into their business more the more I see it and support their cause

The more I allow others to help or even ask for help, the greater value I see in my own ability to help others and a stronger willingness to create content for them develops. Almost as if the reason I'd seen it as cringy in the first place was an unwillingness to accept help from others 

5 small changes that lead to the biggest results
1. Change your metrics
2. Approach everything with intention

I keep telling myself that I need to wait until I'm on my own to cook for myself, but I don't have the habit now so it's unlikely I'll have the habit then. This is a huge limitation to energy and a constant problem

Before/After genuinely works. Video outperformed on all platforms

Can we, for 3 days, go without dopamine sources?
- Social media (Pinterest, Yourube, Insta, TimTok)
- Video games
- Tv shows
- Bad foodi
- Masturbation

It's hard to remain diligent to my diet when I don't measure it

Some things I've noticed from today
- my sleep issues largely come from like stress around, not having control. I noticed this last night when I was trying to go to bed, and I was desperately kind of grasping for a pill or a book or just any method that would like put me to sleep quicker and I think in the end the problem was that I hadn't eaten in a long time and really a lot of my problems this week revolve around I'm not eating.
- Today I haven't felt motivated to make much progress in practice and it doesn't feel like it's a bad thing like I know it'll come back, but I haven't felt that with like marathon running either or meditation and a lot of what I did today was just kind of running through hoops I think the energy drain of war work made it hard to get anything done today. That said I also know that it's like my "week off" so I'm giving myself like grace and free time but I wish I had spent that time doing something other than playing video games because that doesn't really feel like real recovery.
- in spite of not feeling progress in all these other avenues I have wanted to further business more but I can tell I'm like either depressed or just completely out of energy from not eating well enough that I'm not fulfilling of what I wanna do like sending Amanda the summary
- It's a lot easier to take social risks now like today Jesse posted some thing about recording people for free and I invited couple groups to get in with me, but I was low enough energy that I couldn't respond to my boss or my friend or coworker. I just couldn't really deal with much.
- I think I really need like a dopamine detox cause I feel like that's part of the problem combined with just like diet right now it's not that I'm eating poorly. In fact I'm eating really well and that's part of the restriction now it's just that with the exercise, I'm getting I have to make sure that I'm being particular about what I eat. Also, so I can continue to exercise cause I've kind of been neglecting it past two weeks.
- I think heat may have something to do with my depression at times because I felt great when it was starting to get cooler and all of a sudden it's warm again and I feel like I'm stuck
- Once I get this offer set up there's no reason to not just also advertise lessons everywhere especially like with little road signs
- I think being good at social media means not worrying what others really think and just using it as kind of like a testing ground and I feel like the more I begin to align with this mindset the easier is to grow there and the less I like put critical thought into what I'm making and instead just trust that whatever is gonna come out of me is going to help the right people the more I feel inclined to create and it actually feels good to create this kind of stuff like create helpful, engaging informational, content for people that are looking to grow almost as satisfying is like making a video or writing a song
- I Can Frequently Sit At The Kit Now And Surprise With Myself With What Comes Out
- I think I need to find a new way to challenge my cell phone drums right now because I'm kind of not stagnating, but I don't feel challenged enough to get into like a focus state with it like I think most of my problems right now revolve around speed in the genre of jazz rather than something like I don't know complex parts or cool licks or anything like that I say all this, but I think I'm also just demotivated in general so it's hard to say for certain

Trying to find peace in just being myself here, not needing to perform or be anyone else. Realizing though that JJ and I don't have too much in common anymore. There's the peace of being able to just talk openly, but it's more akin to like Taylor or Evan. I don't think I need to put as much effort in it as I was thinking, and I think that alone is rewiring me to see very little energy usage. But it's been nice being able to come in with higher standards and assert myself without fearing their hate

I'm so fucking anxious right now because everyone has my time except for me. I need a solid week off and to myself. I feel like I need an event capacity 

I'm dreading this rehearsal for a lot of reasons. I think a lot of guilt about wanting to leave

Why would I rather play video games than spend time with Mu? Or family? It's a weird phenomenon that I don't like.

Collab project: get a number of Athens artists (or anywhere) and collaborate on a song with all of them

I care deeply about that intersection between what I want to experience and the experience I want to provide for others
