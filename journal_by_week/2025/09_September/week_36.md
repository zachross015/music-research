Feeling extremely depressed and unmotivated right now, especially in drumming. Still got a long practice in, but it was hard. Part of it is overworking myself--waking up at 6 and not stopping until 6 today.

There's a shit ton of anger in me this morning 

Wrote a poem and I feel better. Makes it apparent that creating in any regard is a great way to deal with negativity. Even more, it creates amazing insights. Almost like the problem with negatibe emotions stems from self communication 

Monks dream is stuck in my head

Having a shaved head is part of the mental clarity, it makes the air flow feel real

I go to bed earlier when I wake up earlier

Staying up late while being exhausted takes away time from days where I actually have energy. Really need to stop doing that

STOP TRYING TO SYSTEMIZE WHEN YOU DONT EVEN HAVE THE PROCESS. Manual until there are recurring themes.

Notes on closing jam 9/2/25
- No steady groove. Trying too hard to do way too much. It makes everything lose any sort of momentum and all the emotion drips away.
- The swing to the groove is so much stronger than ever before
- Lots of really good, tasty fill work
- I can't even tell what you're trying to do half the time, like there's no thought being put in there

Why not just work on the songs with Andy?

Anxious going into call with Andy. Left feeling elated, affirmed. Like I'd been seen for the first time in a long time. Grief, yet love? Like I'm reminded of the temporary nature of life and savoring the moments I have with people. Reminded of the more wholesome nature I want to live and that there is a path for me, that there are good people where I am. Some of the best even. Inspired to grow more, train harder.

Record Parisian, break into favorite licks

Intentions:
- Break/Eat
- Walk Mu
- Exercise
- Meditate
- Practice

What am I working towards?
- 10 students, 2/day
- 1 gig every weekend in the area
- Church gig
Take prep/reciew for students down to 20 min per, takes it to 13.3 hours/week. Gigs are both 4 hours. Even at $30/hr that's over 30k. At $50, over 40k. Phase one while I build confidence. Build a safety net then move west.

TikTok:
- 5 grooves used by Max Roach (sub in Art Blakey, etc)

Maybe the lesson in all this is I need more concrete goals

What am I upselling for cheap lessons right now?

One challenge to get over fears of hanging out with people:
- call someone once a day for a month
- Same with hang out with someone

My cause is to build tools to help artists feel comfortable getting started later in life. De-stigmatize the late start mentality. Inspired by my own "late start" and watching my parents start theirs.

I'm so angry. I'm trying to say "there's so much anger present." But I've entwined with it a lot recently instead of watching it and I've had a hard time with confrontation, especially in high stakes scenario. I'm allowing myself to kind of be a dick right now just to learn confrontation.

What's stopping me from, when I put a new song out, texting everyone I know about it? Even just a link? Like need to work through resistances of setting up a coffee or lunch with Andrew Yi and Michael Kralick since they are in the industry. Maybe just get in the habit of 1 weekly meeting with someone. And literally just asking peoples names.

The reason Jaida stuck out so much more as a leader is because she was forthcoming with her struggles, much deeper vulneravility

I think just be transparent with them. Say "I'm working to better my relationships with people in my life. You wanna grab a coffee or lunch sometime?" If I can pay for them, that's all the better.

I also just don't know how to show people my work without looking for affirmation

Lots of insecurity around career again, especially talking about it, especially around mom. Most tied to living at home. A lot around the lack of progress recently. Most of it just feeling terrified to talk about my career, pride as a defensive measure with it

My biggest issue in playing jazz or just improv really is I have no concept of energy flow. I'm trying to develop like meta strategies that will help but I've got no clue where to even start with those. I hardly even understand it to begin wiyh

Easy way to do blogs and newsletters is care less about how they would be perceived. Just write thoughts and let other people have their own take on them

Meditation is getting so much better again

A lot of the initial period of an artist is building the resilience to succeed

My hypothesis in art is that great works, masterpieces, are measured by two things:
- technique of the individual
- inverse of distance between the story they want to tell and the story they create for others, which is measured by honesty, vulnerability, and ability to communicate through their art

Mindfulness is so much better today. Had an "argument" with Zoe, but realized it wasn't my place to convince her. Was detached enough to be curious again. Once again MEDITATION IS THE SOLUTION 

With all the people telling me I'd be a great therapist, there's gotta be a way  of skill transferring that to the drum set

I think I'm trying to be "good enough" to escape my mom's ridicule and criticism. Criticism may be as bad as it is to me because I'm terrified of her doing it behind my back, and all criticism follows. "The Critic" may be this shadow persona

There's more of a blanket of insecurity and shame around everything I do, not limited to just drumming. Like my music, spare change, videos I make, hanging out w me, etc. that's part of why rejection feels so impossible, but also why conversations involving my mom are so painful. I'm waiting for her to be the voice of my hidden shames. Katherine white mentioned how many people are living at home right now. A lot of them in similar career positions. Why should I care so much?

What'd does the first flyer need?

Make it first, then improve


There's some persona that's inhabiting mom. Who is it?

What is my persona around Angelo as a content creator?

Dryad tea #recommendations bronze dragons trove

Intentions:
- work
- Short nap til 11
- Meditate til 12
- Exercise til 1
- To rehearsal at 2

A lot of the approval of an idea comes from the experience of receiving that idea. Good food, good odors, beautiful environment, all contribute to the acceptance of an idea as being beneficial. From liking in Influence. When your mood is raised while receiving this idea, the idea itself becomes associated with that elevation

The person you become on the way to your dreams and achieving your goals--that's what it's all about

Lot of hidden resentments revealed in nightmare about Mom. A lot about her gossip creating impossible standards to please since she'll always be worried. I remember telling her off because I like service industry

I feel like the further I get in this journey, the more it seems like the solution is always to put the word out 

The best way to be more trusting with other people's intentions (eg wanting drum lessons) is to be more transparent and honest and confrontational. I can only anticipate what I do, and if I'm transparent about everything I can expect my clients to be toi

The content idea is to find people on Instagram ask them to collaborate on content together as like a short form thing I basically just like showing up and jamming together it provides a good way to like expand the network and also give me a chance to go meet people and jam with them on random stuff

I feel like Iâ€™m just so early in my understanding of energy and my ear training for it that I have no idea where to begin. (Good content down the line)
