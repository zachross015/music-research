# Week 39: The Dawn spreads her finger tips of Rose

This week was an intentional step back. After suffering through last weeks' burnouts, I decided to make this week about recovery. Due to this, it was a rather uneventful week, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Most of my journals indicate that the burnout of this week was a mixture of dopamine addiction (mainly through things like Pinterest, Youtube, and analytics), giving too much of my time to others, neglecting sleep and diet (much more sparsely than before), and trying to escape the burnout and depression by spreading myself even more thin. This last point was an especially important realization, as my free time became consumed by imbalance. I wanted to practice more, meditate more, exercise more, all the while running on little sleep and not feeding my body properly and spreading myself between friends activities AND all of this was being done as a way to either re-center or remliorate the affects of burnout. The true solution was to do nothing at all. 

In doing nothing, I realized how bad I am at nothing. In this "blank space" so to speak, I still found myself trying to rationalize how to get more done. How I could transcribe more music instead of practicing at a kit, how I could work on more business stuff while running, etc. I found myself wrestling with doing nothing and wondering how I was able to do this during vacation yet not at home. How easy it should seem to spend time with Mu instaed of video games or sit outside and meditate instead of masturbating and napping. I also found myself grappling with sleep issues, noticing for the first time the stress of my control issues and how they plague my sleep. 

I ended the week experiencing much delight. The sun was cool and golden the past two mornings, and I feel refreshed. I noticed how much more willing I am to work in the morning than the afternoons, and that my burnout may more easily be attributable to the drag of working in the afternoons, and trying to keep up with the impossible todo lists I create for the week.
