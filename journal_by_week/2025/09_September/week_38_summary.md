# Week 38

Burnout caused a major crash this week. Aside from Monday and
Tuesday, each day started with opening at Starbucks and the nights
were consumed by a Phish concert, an Athens gig with Isra, JT's
birthday, then Momo's birthday. Exhaustion was the only constant,
driving me deeper into numbness and indifference. There were many
days where the only thing on my mind was circulating pain between the
chaos, the political atmosphere, and death. 

The silver lining in all of this is that I was able to recognize my
burnout and directly attribute all of the pain and numbing procedures
to this. I watched myself consuming mind-numbing content like video
games, analytic obsession, tv, shitty foods, and masturbation as
coping mechanisms for being distraught. But in my consumption, I
noted that the mechanisms I was flocking to for self-soothing used to
be my default habits, demonstrating how far I'd come from a time when
these were the only things I did.

I suffered much neglect due to the lack of energy. I worked out
twice, meditated once, and practiced twice. I had hoped to push
myself socially to meet with Tommy Trautwein and reach out to Aidan
to finish the form, but both were overshadowed by the turmoil I
faced, until eventually on Saturday I crashed after work. 

Aside from this, I recognized this week some social resistances. One
being that many of my resistances to growing socially come from
falling into social influence; forgetting myself in the process. It
is something I worry about and am actively working on. Another is
risking being "annoying" on platforms like TikTok by posting the
things that actively work, or even just experimenting with content in
a simple way. I have enough analytics to see my best performers are
often just jams I've done and have resisted recording myself fuck
around for 10 minutes and clipping the best bits and posting them. It's a simple, automatic growth that has been proven to work. A final thing is just resistance to growing the business out of fear of it working.

Ending this week taking 3 days off to recover, making intentions for returning to dilligence on Tuesday. Biggest priority for this week though is recover and getting the offer finished, which will take work from me AND Aidan (or a different graphic designer, deadline is Friday).


## Achievements

1. Ran a 12k in spite of exhaustion.
2. Demo'd music for Jesse Mangum, to which he commented I was musical, had great cymbal play, and was fun to watch.
3. Sent my first invoice to Isra

## Friction

1. Exhaustion and burnout caused by SCHEDULING WAY TOO MUCH FOR MYSELF IN WAY TOO SHORT OF A TIME. Could've done with (a) not taking the Isra gig or (b) not fully committing to Momo's party, optionally showing up dependent on energy.
2. Mental anguish from Charlie Kirk and Late Night cancellations caused much inner turmoil, which I allowed myself to suffer through and be distracted by for far too long before sitting and dealing with
3. Scheduled too many days for workouts and runs for its priority level. 
4. Time balance for most activities was off this week due to over booking
5. Stress about being able to allocate enough time when I start booking students
6. Analytic obsession
7. Gave up too much of myself for other people
