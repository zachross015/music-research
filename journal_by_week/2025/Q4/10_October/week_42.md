Beginning to believe in myself and my values enough to WANT to share them with others. Not in forcing them, but in standing up for myself, being open and accepting to differences, and coaching where people are following.

The presence of art is beginning to make more sense to me. The idea of like "once it's done it's done" and move onto the next thing. Like once a creative project is done, it's no longer a situation of the present. Promoting it may be, but the experience of creating it is over. Was thinking about this a lot yesterday when JJ sent the stuff from the gig and while observing my interaction with social media. Posting and watching it over and over, even the analytics, felt like obsessing over what others thought about it. But more internally, it was an attachment to the outcome of posting it. The potential for external validation and fulfillment. It's only in letting go of it completely that I feel any sense of peace. I feel like the art itself is the experience of creating it. Once that's over, great. Next!

I think it's because worrying about reception or fantasizing about things like money or fame are forms of living in the future, while holding onto a completed project is like living in the past. The present mentality is always to keep in the present, stay true to the work. This works with humility too because it's not about what you've done or will do, it's about where you are right now and how willing you are to grow and learn new things.

Moving forward with Spare Change now means taking what I've learned from the books and applying them to the band. Be okay with disappointing JJ in the hunt for better. Realize that the consequences pail in comparison to the potential. Be willing to share myself with them and bring my values to the table.

This show went so well and sounded so good BECAUSE of the time I put in. My methods workz

I think a lot of things are starting to click right now. The biggest struggle I faced before now is that I didn't have like a specific time set aside for doing all the things that I didn't want to do you know like the social stuff the business stuff and now that I have it, it's like there's a whole new confidence to doing things that are super far outside my comfort zone. Even in the sense of like with spare change, you know doing the things that I think we need to succeed rather than with JJ. It's like I see myself more as like a leader at this point whereas before I felt like I was just hoping that if I said something that something would be done about it. And I think you said I was putting a lot of pressure on JJ to do a bunch of stuff that he normally wouldn't do and didn't even really want to do it's like now I can do those things and envision myself not doing them permanently like writing out what it is. I'm doing so that I can teach someone else how to do it.

Time killing habits:
- Snoozing
- Shower sleep
- Long rest between workout reps
- Video games

Having the habit set aside for business makes it so much easier to attend to my business. Like with all the things I've been procrastinating, it's like I finally have a space where I can say "This is my job, I have to do this." And putting a time limit on it makes it so simple. Having this space to plan things too makes me feel so inspired, like I can put everything into a nice structure and have tangible accomplishments which I work towards and enter into each session with intention to accomplish tasks. It's so fucking exciting because this is what I've struggled with for so long, and now I can actually do this. I have time and space and identity to say "this is the experiment I need to run" or ask "what does becoming this type of person actually look like?" And creating both tasks and deadlines to meet them. It's fixing revolutionary! I just NEED like progress bars. Something to measure weekly progress. And it's like this is where my dilligence begins to have value. Now when I focus this dilligence on a task, like a website or signs or even drumming goals, it feels the exact same as if Runna made it for me. Like under this framework, so much shit is possible. I can reach out for gigs. I don't feel afraid of people, I feel like it's my job to push this shit to the limit. God I feel so motivated, thank you.

I think something that's becoming more and more apparent to me in drumming is the lack of structure that a struggle with specifically in like playing along of things and it's starting to become like more of a frustration where I recognize that a lot of my tendencies are to leave the groove behind for Phil work or something like that or even just a fiddle all around and I feel like in playing with like backing tracks. I struggle to hold the form in my mind, not only to do that but to create anything meaningful from it it feels like I've been speaking in words this whole time, and I'm beginning to learn how to speak more in sentences in paragraphs, but I'm at the very beginning of that and so it's still kind of difficult. Like I was playing along to these backing tracks and I'm also tired so it's hard to say for a certain whether you know it was really bad or not but like all I could think is like oh man like it feels good to play, but I don't feel like I'm creating anything emotional with what I'm doing and… I feel like there's some ambiguity there because I haven't recorded myself enough and played it back enough to know if like my intentions are matching up with my performance. This is especially prominent and jazz. Where like I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. I guess it's like a good thing. I'm realizing all this stuff not like it. It means that it's come to my awareness and it's being worked on. The real goal is that like I wanna hardly use Phil work I wanna really just hone in on groove and get rhythm right you know just use fills for emphasis or something or transition but if I can get to a point where it's just solid groove constantly that would be phenomenal, especially if I could do it with just like kick snare hat, and maybe ride

What am I running away from? What am I trying so hard to numb? The loneliness. Fears of actually starting the business. Indecision. Even when all is growing, I'm not happy. Not sad. Just monotone. Is this peace? I don't like it. I don't like the confidence. The clarity. The action. It's all changing so fast now and I'm scared. I'm not worried about what any of them think anymore. I have the strength to stand up for myself. It's all so foreign. I've embodied the humility I've long sought. I get so many ideas on marketing effectively. I have leads. I have ideas. I'm trying all of it. And yet it's 2.5 hours past when I want to be asleep. I had too much caffeine. And sugar. I didn't exercise. I feel good. But I feel numb. Or is it calm? I don't understand it and it scares me. For once I feel like anything is possible. I see a future now where growing my business works. Where I understand how to bring my dream to life, one step at a time. I feel so much more consistent with the life I'm creating because I've built a structure which takes care of the strategic parts of it, and I'm habitualizing the maintanence of this structure. I have enough discipline now and enough knowledge of my limits to always stay within their bounds, so there's constant progress towards goals and changes in my life. I only feel attracted to love. I've ditched the drama. I feel confident enough to talk to beautiful women and business opportunities alike. I scarcely feel the suffering. Yet today, I ate a crumbl cookie after drinking too much caffeine and as a result spent the day masturbating, video gaming, and glued to my phone. I'm not saying this because I feel any way upset about it, but it feels like I'm trying to numb something. Maybe it's just the lack of energy from sugar and caffeine crashes, which is consistent with my findings from when I started all this. But it sucks thinking how temporary life is, and yet I choose to make some days like this. There's so much progress since I started my journey, where every day was almost exactly like this. But I think today I just want to understand why I did this. Did it really start with the coffee?

Hitting all sides of the business:
- Target family members who need help understanding how to better support artists in growth

Adding selling features within the app attracts all sorts of good marketing. Anyone can begin to sell routines and shit

Trade growth marketing for recording?

The system I made is already too terse I think. Need something more granular that's already cohesive with what I have. Like increasing granularity where I can say "what's accomplishable during the next x period."

Okay yeah maybe instead of planning the week, looks at the goals and practices towards those. Log results in notion, tagged with the exercise.

Starbucks has slowly become a cesspool of drama and negative energy
