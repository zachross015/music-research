Write two books
- the meta concepts of every book

I UNDERSTAND. It's not about doing what you don't want. It's about coming up with ideas that genuinely excite, testing them, and using their results to REFINE YOUR VIEW OF REALITY, and use that view to create more ideas to test. To do so effectively requires a dedicated process for testing and refining a system, documenting what is being tested and sticking to it until the end and documenting the results

What's a higher priority? Developing systems/discipline or starting lessons? Or writing the ebook?

Connection through drumming

My dilligence to myself is reflected so much in the world around me, and the lack of structure in it. It's hard to take my goals and systems seriously because of this

The business of expertise
The practice
Real artists don't starve
Company of one
Clockwork
Systemology

One of the eye opening parts of E myth was just how much I've been tactical rather than strategic. It's put words to the frustration of living day to day rather than having any other perspective, and the burnout that comes with it

Maybe it's creating a prototype business model for successful indie bands

Think about it this way: building the business with the people in my area may not be exactly what I want right now, but it beats Starbucks by miles. It also reclaims 20+ hours of my week.

What does the ask muscle look like in the context of my business?
- Producers for studio time
- People for free lessons (give them 4)
- Bigger ensembles for auditions and such
Get Schedule 1 level of good at this.


Journaling prompts help so much more than I previously imagined

Basic way of going about this is to write out all ideas, then use weekends to test them. I don't know if I'm against the entrepreneurial mindset so much as I can't fathom if an idea is worth pursuing and so I "people please" or spend energy creating ideas then doubting them because of a lack of evidence. Been doing this my whole life

What's really going to help is to set aside time for manager/entrepreneur parts. And also really sitting with and strategizing goals. Testing out what works and how long it takes, even from a practice stand point, and recording real results

Maybe the book is building a business as a creative

I think it all starts with the questions
1. how do I do it
2. How do I make sure I do it

It seems like million dollar weekend is more about stress testing ideas and see what's pliable rather than get rich quick schemes.

JOE! His name is Joe!

After kind of struggling with it all day, it's all starting to finally I think kind of clicking my head, but I realize just how much turbulence it's caused because I slipped into my numbing again to try and release the anxiety. But it seems like all of it is about just going just doing it and having the space to step back from it at the same time and I think a lot of my day-to-day habits have formed around having new space to kind of strategically manage my life they've all been very tactical and I think that's the same thing I was afraid was gonna get reflected in like a business situation and so I think setting forward into the week and into the coming months like the main habit I wanna focus on is just you know discipline doing what I say I'm gonna do or at least setting aside time to manage and deal with things without sacrificing like drum practice. Because I feel really bad that I didn't practice today.

How the ask muscle can work:
- Ask Josh (or other graphic designers) if he ever wanted to do concert posters
- Offer the posters to a bunch of local musicians at a discount 
Or even really, just ask a bunch of local musicians what they struggle with

If I really wanted to focus exclusively on YouTube, weekly video essays is a way to do it. Or even just playing through the songs I've recorded already. I'm just trying to understand a way to do so that isn't fully lifeless? Or at least speaks to me and is genuinely helpful. But I'd want to differentiate them from the main stuff. That said, I think the starting niche is drummers who are obsessed with growth. How about doing this just as an experiment? Yo that's a fantastic idea. Even just thinking of EVERYTHING as an experiment. An adventure. But I think it only works if I do results comparison, especially on intentions, and find a way to maintain focus on the long term

Maybe for an ASK task: invite 100 people personally to this gig.

Taught Drummer's guide to practice

What about just posting weekly reviews to YT?
- tactic driven. What's the purpose?

Intentions for today: Get back on track
- Eat
- Walk Mu
- Exercise
- Talk through resistances to being annoying in business context
- Meditate
- Practice

Make everything about it personal. The space you create, the stage you create, the songs you make. Let yourself bleed into the world until there's no telling where you end and the world begins. Bring your favorite rug on the stage. Light it with a lamp. Bring your vibe wherever you go. Demand the same of others that you demand of yourself. If you aren't doing those things, it's a true reflection of how much respect you have for yourself and the craft and how importantly you view and value the work you create.

A lot of my resistance comes from a fear of not doing it in a properly manipulative or people pleasing or effective way

Need a teaching practice to inform the guides I want to make

Over caffeinating is part of the problem, bleeds into heedlessness and lack of energy which I think causes the over consumption of everything to deal with tha pain. How can I learn to just sit with it?

Turn it into an experiment. How many people can I get out to our show just by asking? Worst case, it's good practice for my own group or no one comes out (they already wouldn't be)

Get past the "annoying" resistance. I think that's the only barrier to being an entrepreneur 

Do a template. Send it to 100 people. Measure response and conversion

The depressed side of me is a compulsive spender, masturbator, and eater. That's its way with dealing with pain I've found, and that's always when I slip up

TWO A/B tests:
1. two text templates
2. One phone sign, one QR code

I think if I had to describe the issue and its entirety it's that at this moment, I am exhausted because of everything I learned last week. Not only my exhausted, but I realized that the way I've been doing everything hasn't been structured enough towards the things I've gone to accomplish which I've had to do this something repeatedly where I refine the goals I've come up with like a year ago or two years ago or something like that, but I've hit this snag where I see how difficult those past two years have been and how it's gonna be difficult to keep doing that moving forward, not in the sense of drumming, but in the sense of like everything outside of dropping at the same time, I'm so desperate to get out of my job at Starbucks that I want to do anything it takes to get that and I've kind of been like that for a long time, my whole career so far has been built around, trying to find whatever sources of income I can get from drumming by doing everyone else's work you know being someone else's band teaching someone else's lessons being in someone else's Music and I think that's worked for a long time but I think I'm at a point where I know that that's not what I want to do forever I see myself as like a prominent solo figure in the future, but I think what conflicts with this idea is that in order to be a solo feature I have to include other people's constantly when it comes to things like practice I'm reluctant to write down my methods and the things I've learned over the years because I'm surrounded by other drummers that I think from an ego perspective I'm afraid that if I give them what I've learned that they will become better than me and they will make my work obsolete and I think I'm selfishly trying to hold onto these things because I don't want to help them I want to be better than them because that kind of connects to everything that I'm already trying to do you know like I want to be a soloist and I think part of the soloist has like this competitive edge to it where I think I have to be better than everyone around me in order to get all the work in the area which I've also been learning just isn't true. You know people wanna work with someone they know that they're friends with that they trust over just someone that's good for the whole reason of egotism and so I'm at this point where no one knows me that well because I prioritize practice so much you know the people that are getting the gigs are people that are friendly and they go out and then they practice, but probably not nearly as much and not nearly as diligently so that's where like one big failure is occurring and then the other one I see is that I'm like afraid to teach anyone like especially in the area and especially kids because I don't wanna have to deal with the parents but that's such a small issue in comparison to the rest of it is like I feel like I know I wanna make my name as a soloist like doing my own music writing my own stuff making my own art and everything like that, and some part of me sees it as this usually competitive thing where I have to completely obliterate the competition and be better than everyone in the area and that even if I'm like approaching this from a teaching standpoint, I have to be better than the people in my area in order to teach them, you know there's such like a high pressure to practice more and grow faster so that way I can attract the people that are already playing that I'm like I get frustrated with the whole lot of it and I feel like these books have opened my eyes to the idea that it doesn't have to be that way, and that by writing my methods in publishing them and being kind and generous with them that I'll get more business in a sense but I mean, I think the end you're lying issue is like I'm selfish and I'm not as generous as I wish I could be and I'm not quick to fix things so I'm just kind of sitting in the mud right now trying to put the pieces back together you know trying to understand like where do I find the time to step into the manager role to teach lessons to organize my information in a way that I can give it to other people and try to be more generous with what I have and like how can I start to structure things in a way that I'm giving more than I'm receiving you know where I'm setting up opportunities for connection working with people and setting up, you know, jam sessions, or gigs with people or lessons or creating coaching materials or does that and the other it's so I guess I'm like worried about making myself obsolete in this next phase and at the same time I'm worried that by going into teaching I'm doing the exact thing that would make me obsolete you know I'm taking away time from practice. It's like you're not. It's not always gonna be that way, but it may start out that way and I hate that because the thing is Starbucks to me it's been a great place to be, but I've learned everything I could learn there and now it's just wasting my time and it's like if I had that time dedicated towards either practice or lessons then it would both be more fulfilling and it would educate me more for whatever comes next in line with that I have some kind of mental identification with the idea of what a teacher is as being someone who's failed to succeed at the other part of it and so stepping into a role as a teacher to me is something I'm afraid of because I'm worried that I'll get comfortable or that I will stop trying to become a master or an expert and instead just focus on doing that for other people and it's like it's giving up this selfishness. And I think that's the hardest part of it. It's like I am selfish, but I have been and I think admitting that is hard because I thought I was being generous but now every time I practice it's like is this just selfish you know is wanting to be amazing at this at this point just selfish. It's like if not then how do I start approaching it more selflessly like how do I do a better for someone else? How can I wanna be better for other people you know how can I be more generous with it and how can I even want to. So I think that's where I'm at is like I'm driving what feels like the selfish side of my dream and I see how this next part would make me so much more better for other people, but I struggle to find a way to still want to be the best version of myself for myself but maybe that's not what it's about. Maybe it's allowing myself to be the best version of myself for other people and intern I get to be the experience the best version of myself which is still something that I struggled to understand

I think I'm just being selfish. The more I reflect on the issues I'm dealing with, the more I see anger in the "selfishness" or "supportlessness" of others. Like right now I'm angry at my family for not being able to make a gig. I am genuinely hurt, but I also see myself wallowing in the pity. The feelings are real. I'm upset at how hopeless it feels to try and get people out to a show. At the same time, I've never really refined my system for bringing people out to a show. It's basically just a matter of allowing it to come up in conversation the week of. That has never worked tbh. 

I think my hopelessness for other things, like lessons, follows the same hopelessness as getting people to shows. It's like what's the point? Why waste the time, money, and energy? No one is going to show up. No one cares. And all I care about is the money. It all makes more sense when I frame it that way.

I think I'm also scared of like...what if mastery isn't in the books for me? Like I'm terrified to take this next step into the next chapter because what if it takes away from my practice? I want mastery above all else right now, or even just to be held in as high of a regard as like Benny Greb and Dave Weckl. But I'm starting to think that idealizing that is part of what keeps me from achieving it in a way. And that holding onto this ideal may be keeping me from the next leg of my journey. Like what I want is for teaching or creating educational material from what I learned to be something that fuels my drive further, but I'm worried that it will consume my time or that I may fall into greed and neglect the practice, which is the most critical part to my growth I think. I'm also afraid that by stepping into the role of the teacher, I'm giving up my role as the student. That weirdly, I might find more enjoyment in doing that than what I'm doing right now. And it's a hard pill to swallow thinking that what if what I find here is better than what I have? Is mastery even worth it? Especially if mastery is the route of constantly facing rejection whereas something like teaching is much more comfortable in a sense? I still feel 100% like my calling is drums. But what if I'm wrong?

Intentions:

- Walk Mu - 1240
- Exercise - 1340
- Meditate 1430

Would actually be super cool to start bringing my plants to gigs with me

Teaching is as much a level of marketing research as it is helping other people because in teaching other people, I learned the language that I need to use to communicate things effectively not just for picking up more people, but in order to adequately say like… OK as an example like if I'm learning how to teach site reading or even just reading music it helps to talk to a student about it and try to explain it to them then pick up their words on explaining it back to me so that way when I explained it to someone else I can use their language to communicate things more effectively and so by doing so I can take this back to educational material and content where I use their language to effectively educate. The same way going and playing in front of people, especially at like a jazz jam or something and imitating what they do is away on picking up their language so that it's also like a form of I guess marketing material it all kind of feeds it in itself you know mastery is learning everyone's language and being able to communicate effectively with them so like the things you would play at say a drum clinic would be very different from the things you would say at a jazz jam or at a recording session or at a live show

I think my ability to motivate or inspire others to show up at a gig is a reflection of my own ability to motivate an inspire myself to complete goals and I think it's the same level of information needed for both. You know you need like Smart goals to motivate yourself to get somewhere to do something to be somewhere at a certain time but I think Smart goals are the same as the marketing principles of influence and that if I wanna be better at convincing other people or even just creating an environment that other people want to show up to my gigs I have to approach it in the same way that I approach goal setting which means I really have to improve my goal setting
