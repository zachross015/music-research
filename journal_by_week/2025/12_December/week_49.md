I overloaded my task list today. It's 5:22 and I didn't send info to Jalen or make dinner. My mind is racing with all the open loops needed to be completed and how little money I have.
- Booking appointments
- Potential tire repairs
- Mu medication
- Sending Jalen info 
- Wishing I could pay Jennifer 
- Christmas gifts
- Adopting new students
While being tired from learning so much and needing to relax. Also trying to be more diligent in planning/analyzing this stuff. It's frustrating knowing that I need to make money now, seeing the possibility and exhilaration of doing so, ye doing nothing. Like not even reaching out to Jalen. Or putting up signs. Not trusting myself enough. Making excuses for not doing those things. Would've gotten so much more done today if I hadn't napped. It gets dark too early to shove all this in. And I'm on the verge of the next step, but like last time I'm still too scared. I don't know why.

What is all the indo I want to send to Jalen?
- Sticks
- Pad
- Get playlist or songs and recommend how to start
- Set up lesson

That's enough for today. You've done a lot. You've accomplished a lot. You get a break now. Tomorrow is hiking with Kevin, but before hand you will send info to Jalen, buy Christmas gifts, and cook dinner. Roughly in that order. You have two hours to accomplish it, I reccomend messaging Jalen during your 30 to get that out of the way

---

I'm working towards being more diligent and disciplined. But in doing so, I realize how diversely my efforts are spread at the moment. Multiple unrelated streaks. Many tasks unrelated to my goals. It's no wonder I feel overwhelmed at all that wasn't accomplished! 

I enjoy cooking and reading more than I enjoy video gaming.

Intentions:
- Meditate
- Practice 
	- Warmup
	- endurance/sprint
	- Monks dream
- send Jalen info
- Run
- Grocery

Talking to Jeff today (thanks Jeff), realized an avenue I never explored. I was an oldest child so scarcely had competition, until I was around David. I think David was competition because he was a male higher on the pecking order? I always lost to him or was injured by him so I think I grew to resent the more alpha male mentality in a way. It's worth looking into this as an avenue to trauma and male connection

A lot of energy problems in the winter can be chalked up to a combination of shifted diet and moving against the seasons. Like I've noticed I eat a lot more carbs in the winter than I intend to, which I think is a lack of blood sugar problem? Or at least, I'll get fairly hangry when I'm missing that sugar kick, which spirals me. So it's often times I try to push too hard expecting to have the same energy levels as I'd have in summer

What got done today?
- Work
- Basic Practice
- Ordered all of Joey's gifts
- Bought the tire repair kit and new shoes
- Bought groceries for week
- Put together list of card recipients
- Talked with Jalen about starting lessons
- Cooked 1/2 of meal
- Sat down and analyzed where things went wrong

What didn't get done and why?
- Didn't order the cards or gift for mom.
  - Cards were because 1. I didn't have all the addresses at the ready and ran into a mental barrier thinking of how I was going to ask for them. Instead of going ahead and doing the work, I sat there thinking about it forever until I grew tired and took a nap
    - Disciplined person would have followed through.
  - Mom was because we hadn't any ideas between the three of us.
    - Why didn't you brainstorm?
- Didn't finish meal
  - No feta. Why don't you just run to the store? It's past 6 PM. Too late. It's not too late to the disciplined person. Doesn't that bring me straight to burnout? I have no idea any more. When do I get to relax if that's the case?
- Didn't fix tire. Not the highest priority today, plus didn't completely intend on doing so. Bad priorities?
- Didn't send recording to Isra. Not the highest priority today.
- Didn't organize Notion. Was a suprise that I was going to be able to get to it anyways, so lack of intention.
- No exercise. Lack of intention/priority/discipline.
Alot didn't get done because I napped. Lack of sleep from night before. But that's easy to blame, alot also didn't get done because I didn't realize how much I'd tried to shove into one day / how long alot of things took. Especially with Starbucks.

I think it's as simple as everyday making a consistent and constant intention to complete all I've set out to complete, and looking at what's not done and understanding why

Cultivating discipline and self trust is a matter of fulfilling promises or decisions regardless of how you feel in the moment. Doing so makes it easier to trust you'll achieve what you set out to do

Fears around money come from
- Never having been good at asking for money in the first place
- Lack of persistence and follow through to make other people's dreams happen
Growing discipline and follow through makes the second much easier. If I can follow through with, say, setting up some one else's plans (eg lessons) and attuning them to a path which benefits us both (without controlling them) then that's how the business should be thought of.

When I make sure that I see everything that I've done to completion throughout the day, it makes everything seem more apparent how much I spread myself thin because I'm looking at everything I'm trying to accomplish and I see ways that I could expand upon them and I'm unable to do it like right now. I told Kevin I was gonna go hiking with him, but I also also need to at some point cook dinner and I need to send Ezra a demo. I need to make a purchase Christmas gifts and it's like trying to do it all at once feels impossible, and the only way to do it is to move fast, but on the other hand, I feel like it's easier to move fast when I make sure at the end of the day every day I'm rewarded with something so it's like throughout the day if I commit to pushing as hard as I can then getting to the end of the day it makes it feel like I've earned what I worked for

Hey Jalen! Excited to get started on your drum journey! All you really need to get the ground running is some sticks which I'll put a link for down below. 

If you have the space and money for it, I'd recommend also investing in a practice kit. Send me a budget you're willing to put down and I'll throw together some options you can work with. 

Either than that, we can get started whenever you're ready. All I need from you is a playlist of songs you are interested in learning and we can start lessons from there.

What is the anxiety here? That I'll ruin a friendship if I get rejected. That by exposing this vulnerability, I'll be rejected for it and seen as weaker. That I'll be ostracized for how money hungry I am. That I'm not good enough. That I won't improve. That I'm bad and will make things awkward between us. That it will reveal to me how awkward I already am.

Don't overwhelm with options at the offset. They don't know what to choose. Their goal is to be able to play with friends. Give them the most direct path there.

Offer options:
- Setting up a dedicated practice for different budgets

People crave structure. Routine. Being able to consistently show up and see something. Watching Coding Train and going to Starbucks, I see this now. There's such a backlog that I go back and watch all the time, and I feel safe at work. We don't get to decide the part people enjoy, just that we enjoy creating it or being a part of it. If we can learn to create this structure, this consistency, then we create it for others too.

Her name is Casey

What about a music company that guides musicians in that way? Structures career growth by setting them up with lessons, gigs, etc. all with a connected network, and a required training. #ideas

Weekly YouTube videos or live streams documenting the creative process for a song. Take user submitted songs and write drum parts for them. Maybe start off with drum less songs? I actually really like this, it's at tha intersection of coding train and Bob Ross. More exploratory #ideas 

Need to sort out Notion to group ideas tha belong to different branches. That way, when it comes time to dive in, the plans are pretty much already in place

Nature is fucking sick - That's what it is
Shirt ideas

I'm starting to get that by choosing one thing over another. I'm having to prioritize more and if I'm going to do something to completion, I need to be almost choosing systematically what the more important things are to me. So today, for instance I have about two hours before I'm going to meet my friends and do something with them and with all that I've scheduled especially for this week. I'm having to decide between getting gifts for people or meditating or practicing or figuring out solutions to the month problem I had or exercising and I basically have an hour and a half to commit to something and do it to the best of my ability. It's like I have to accept that by choosing one thing I'm also choosing not to do all of those other things, and so I need to start being wiser about the way that I decide these things and I think for today it's really hard to figure out which one I wanna do you know like I need to start cutting out more things. The one I'm drawn most towards is practice and meditation because I think those are the things that in the long run mean the most and are the most significant, but I'm also unsure of that because it almost seems like all the problems I've had this week or all the goals I had we're all much more loaded than I had thought they were which is a part because of how little time I put into thinking about what he was gonna take to do these things but also because of things I didn't know about

Intentions:
- Work
- Nap
- Meditate

# 12-05-2025

Tomorrow morning:
- wake 6
- Meditate til 7
- exercise weight training 
- Walk Mu 
- Plan structure 
- Order poster for Alex
- Practice drums (dilligence + learn monk)
- Leave

Having fixed goals with the intention to complete makes it easier to accomplish things I set out to do. Not only that, but having that fixed endpoint makes it feel like "yeah, I made sure to do all that I meant to do." It's a daily achievement.

It's not just horny, it's more connected to people. I think horniness is a result of that

One battle after another #movies #recommendations

I feel like I'm trying to make growth as an artist and as a business mutually exclusive, but what if it isn't? What if it's building a base camp for fellow travelers? What if it's building a source of income to support the rest of it? The only risk it plays is taking up the time I would need to make the music itself. Is it an excuse to avoid that? No because it's also going to be a part of that once the recording and live branches are established 

Arturia microbrute

Really cool challenge: become proficient enough at any instrument to always be able to play the room. During conversations, read the emotions and know exactly what to play to enhance those emotions.

I'm like super confident and also super horny right now

It makes me wonder if I'm not just deceiving myself here because like I see you know like all these other artists or I guess I'm I'm listening to this rich role podcast authors talk about writing books and stuff like that and it makes me wonder if I'm not just like building this company as a way to deceive myself into believing that there's I have control over the future or I have a structure for the future or have some kind of safety you know like I feel like I'm going into it believing 100%. It's going to work which is a good thing but it's also like am I doing that instead of doing the hard thing and making the art and it's like this thing I keep coming back to like am I trying to be a shadow artist or am I being an artist like am I trying to be a successful drummer or am I trying to create a certainty around being a successful drummer or am I like looking to build a path that creates one it's it's kind of confusing and I don't really know. I guess it doesn't feel like it's a bad thing. It's just confusing I guess cause it's like you know what if this is like a distraction what if it's just it's it's all really confusing you know cause I feel like I guess there's a route where… OK maybe I didn't even know how to explain it. It's like I feel like I could move quicker if all I was trying to do was get lessons for myself get gigs for myself and get recording options for myself and stuff like that but it feels like there's less money there or in other words I provide less value by doing something like that instead of like creating opportunities and jobs for other musicians and other people because it feels like as much as I am creating more art. I'm also creating a way to fund that arm you know like if I build this business then not only can I find my own art, but I can find other people support and do songs with them and even attracts like talented musicians, and it feels like this resolution to this problem, I've struggled with for so long, which is just finding people and playing with people and getting people that want to play music that I write but I also I'm just like I don't know maybe maybe I'm just trying to create problems with maybe I'm just trying to look for reasons to fail at it and so that I don't have to actually do anything like it feels like building this business is one of the most generous things I can do especially if my goal in the future is to make it easier for other people to pursue careers and you know to give them an option for it that isn't just like the the smokers at Guitar center shit like that. What if all I'm doing is just creating a competitor

There's a really good quote that I just heard in this podcast and it is what would it look like for this to be easy. And I think it's a great quote because it's made me think about something. I've been thinking about a lot recently, which is the idea that you know suffering creates like attachment basically it's not just that suffering or that attachment is suffering. It's that suffering creates an attachment to something like if you're working on something and you work really hard on it and you're pouring your heart onto the page and you're destroying yourself to make it. It creates this like strong attachment to it and it's expecting that because you've put so much into it. That other people are going to get the same amount out of it you know it's expecting that people are going to like exactly the things you like, but that's just not true. You know if you just kind of pump stuff out then like the audiences for that kind of stuff naturally just come to you you know the things that… Like it one way of thinking of it is if every piece of art you do is incredibly deeply thought out then it's expected of you to do that every time. Whereas of everything you do is kind of just made off of your brain you know just quickly done that that's what it becomes expected of you and only one of them like produces enough for people to come constantly you know you have the one route where you're producing stuff all the time and it's not hard for you. It's just easy it can still be emotional, but it doesn't have to be devastating and that person creates so much more than the person who grueling over it the entire time without even a guarantee that anyone will resonate with like what you've made. It's so like that end why am I just rolling over the same songs over and over again like why am I not just writing more music? Why am I not just showing up and doing that every day and I think that's the thing I keep going back-and-forth with us like yeah I can create this business, but that's not gonna make me write music every day you know that's not gonna pump out new songs all the time because maybe it is that easy maybe if I just like shout out a song at least every day then it would just work.

So I'm driving down to Savannah and I stopped in Milledgeville to do some planning some managerial work which it feels great that I finally have like sitting down to do it and that I'm I'm doing my best to go through with it, but it was a rough start today, so I didn't actually really get much done. I didn't really have the momentum to. I guess finish it and I guess where I'm at. Is trying to figure out what the direction I've wanna go in with what I'm doing cause I feel like I'm trying to clarify what this business is you know I am I think I'm having a hard time with it because I think it's different things for different people you know for I think what I'm trying to accomplish what I'm trying to build is a company that pumps out musicians that are like artists through and through and I think I'm trying to do it in a way that's similar to the things that I'm doing now like I'm trying to create a position and a job for people who are going through the same thing that I'm going through and I guess where I'm having trouble with it is deciding where the business begins and ends you know like is it importance for us to develop a curriculum or is it important to higher musicians and train them to be good teachers and develop their own curriculum you know I think as as a company building a curriculum is important because it's shows people what to do you know like it creates quality people but like I guess in my head it's like not only do I want to attract musicians who are willing to grow… It's hard to talk about. I guess it's hard to explain because I think what I wanna do is I want to create a safe space for musicians to grow into a career you know and a lot of that includes the process of you know networking and I don't know gigs and stuff like that like OK maybe it's easier if I explain what I wanna be able to do with it. I want to be able to offer scholarships to musicians I want to be able to teach musicians how to get their own gigs how to get their own clients how to get their own students how to write their own songs how to find their own opportunities how to create their own opportunities and within the school, I want to pay them for this. I want to be able to give them that money they need to you know exist as an incubation and aside from that like basically it's hard it's it's really hard to explain like starting off with the lesson right or like a lessons company I want to be able to bring in musicians and the company itself will take a cut of the profits of whatever they're teaching, but it gives them a space to also practice. You know to force them insurance and healthcare and opportunities so that they can continue to grow as an artist while they're honing their own craft, but part of the contingency on that is that they have to be disciplined like they have to come to this place and expected to be as a dojo you know come there and practice every day and like even as part of that, I want to take a lesson from Discover Strength and have people teaching each other at the school so that way like you know even once a week the people that are there are still getting lessons. The people that are working. There are still learning how to be better and better musicians and so like I want to bring in top talent or at least like top potential and grow them and so it's like I want to start this place off as a music school I guess or like a music school, where our target audience is really the musicians that are teaching and then grow it into a place that's more open to other opportunities. You know have a recording studio have a a gig booking kind of avenue like I want this to be kind of a I don't know like a pop-up center like in my head I'm comparing it a lot to like somewhere like Berkeley or Institute of music or anything like that and it's like I wanted to have that quality but to be able to do it on smaller scale so that's like it's like an in between of Berkeley and like music and arts where Berkeley takes top musicians and turns them into top musicians and then you know music in arts is somewhere that just lets everyone come in so I want to be able to create like I guess pop-up centers which takes top musicians and continues to train them, but allows them to teach everyone you know that the company itself is an aid to their career. It's not just somewhere that they go to work like through the company we give them opportunities we give them scholarships. We teach them how to teach better we teach them how to get their own gigs how to book their own lessons how to market themselves how to develop like a personal brand or a band brand how to grow a van how to record yourself how to record other people you know I want to create a company that takes everything that I've kind of learned over the past couple years doing this to myself and it teaches other people to do it so that way like developing yourself as a career musician isn't something that you need to go to like a prestigious school to do or even just get lucky to do like I think it doesn't have to be that way and I think if we grow something that way it's it's just gonna create better and better musicians and better and better music and I think that's the crux of it. It's like I want to create a space that teaches musicians how to be career musicians and helps to in destined musicians that way, so long as they're willing to continue to be like diligent and grow and not only that but pays them for it you know and maybe like a part of that is down the line like we managed them too. We were the record label or whatever like I really wanted it to be something where the company just helps people to build their own relationship relationships you know it's it's not just. I don't know how to explain it. It's like like I want part of the rules to be you know, there's there's one located. There's like a branch located in Atlanta the musicians that come in I want to train them to you know scout out new venues in Atlanta. Talk to the managers there and scout out new recording studios you know find people figure out how to find people that are recording and how to network with them and you know things like that like finding opportunity I want to teach people how to find financial opportunities as an artist in like hyper locality do you know because I'm always a big fan of like the whole distributed network system and I feel like we can take that information and apply it to like a music company that be huge.
