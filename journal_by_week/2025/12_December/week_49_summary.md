# Week 49

This week was effective, yet slow and short. I'd realized how quickly I was trying to move was just due to how busy I made myself. Not productive. I spent the week observing my discipline and dilligence. I'd put too much into the week even without knowing about it, and I've begun to see how little is actually accomplishable in the week versus what I once thought I was capable of. Ended the week in Savannah, not fulfilling any of the tasks I'd set out to do. 

That said, I'd gotten alot done. I've realized how impactful things like momentum and discipline are to the trajectory of my days, and it's made me certain that starting the day with adversity makes it so much simpler to do harder things. Although I wasn't able to fully accomplish everything I'd set out to do, it's become obvious why I'd struggled with it before and I've gleamed new insights into my own ability to accomplish.

I spent more time with friends this week than I had in a while, and it was nice feeling generous for a change. 

## Achievements

1. Worked through all of the solo in Reflections in one night inspite of resistance
2. Played memorial service
3. Came up with first draft for structure (pre dojo idea)

## Friction

- Thinking too much instead of doing as a form of procrastination
- Simultaneously, lack of intelligent thought before acting in a way that didn't prioritize goals
- Both planning out gifts adn building a structure took longer than I thought, so neither got done
- Didn't finish learning Monk or Reflections because of time restrictions
  - Is this true or was I lazy? No I think I spent a good amount of time on it, but doing both was way too much
- Spontaneously went on trips with friends which took away energy and time needed to complete things that needed to be done this week
  - Problem isnt the trips so much as the planning for them. Was already going down to Savannah this weekend, so hanging out with Kevin and Amanda, while great, took away alot of time

## The ONE Thing

First off, need to stop pushing this off until night time when I have no thoughts or energy.

Second, solution to this is just to be more disciplined to my approach to goal setting. Making sure I sit with the problem and make an attempt to come up with a solution. Ie spend more time brainstorming instead of floundering and working instead of procrastinating. I have hardly if ever came up with a solution solely by sitting and mulling.

## Goals

1. Finish Christmas gifts (moms and cards mailed)
2. Comfortable with all of Monk's Dream (unmemorized)
3. Dojo Belt Draft / Curriculum structure draft
4. Go to Velvet Note and introduce yourself
