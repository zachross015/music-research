It seems like everywhere with a ranking is both taken more seriously and easier to transcend. Eg marathon vs 5k, army rank, dojo belt, etc

Grants for emerging artists from incubators, good idea to tap into.

Jojo idea actually seems super obvious I guess and I don't really know how to start planning it though like I guess the basic idea even if it's not a dojo or instead like I don't know like a Marine Corps or something I feel like the verbiage on that needs to be fine-tunes to attract like discipline people, but the idea of it should be that it's about kind of crafting people into some musicians where like the requirements need to be less about I don't know. I guess the quick path it needs to be less about the quick path, the easy path and more about the long-term in the same way that like becoming a monk or becoming like a tae kwon do master or you know anything like that it's about when you're in the dojo, gaining a basic proficiency over the instrument and then when you go beyond the dojo, it's about not only the proficiency of the instrument, but the strategies that the proficiency is used in and it goes from being a band member to a band leader to a I don't know like a band coordinator or something like that leads multiple bands to being in charge of the person that leads multiple bands it kind of going up that hierarchy and it seems like every tier should have like a panel judges in a test to pass that tier and the panel of judges have to reach a consensus, whether or not they meet the requirements which I guess it's kind of a college is due already and also to pay for like the kind of test, but it's something like I wanna be legitimate with you know not just like pumping out mediocre musicians, but like I want someone who comes to the school and leaves it to be trained, not only in like technical proficiency, but also the art of like being a good musician you know showing up on time being generous with how you play and playing for the music not for yourself and stuff like that like I don't want people being able to leave the school as like egoists and I want the leads to be the people that continue to come through the school in our incubator through it and stuff like that I don't know. I guess it makes it worse studying like martial arts system stuff like that you know something that has like a general or a genuine or hierarchy to it so tired I have way too much caffeine this weekend not nearly enough water not great food. I'm feeling the effects of it but like I'm genuinely excited about this idea, I feel like this could actually work. He's gonna apply as much to like students as it does adults or teach group kids as much as it does adults there's still like I think a lot of specifics that need to be hammered out, but it's like a self feeding system too like you can raise someone and then they become the people that teach their that's the long-term


But I think the reason it would work so well because like you could reasonably create the same level progression that someone had in something like rock band and it's like if you use the dojo for basic proficiency and use like the incubation as things outside of it, then you could really create like a meaningful way to grow musicians that is it just go to school for it like it. I think it creates an even better alternative to having to go to like an expensive college because you get paid for it you know if you're going to the dojo and you work there then it reasonably what it should do is create like a skill path that teaches you how to succeed and to build your own opportunities in a manage people and stuff like that I had something else there too it was

I really want is for higher ranks to have a higher level of respect just at the offset like someone sees someone that's like a you know past the introductory levels like sees them as like a rank five or something it's just instant recognition or not even fame, but just instant respect for their ability to play you know I want there to be like a quality of standard where people can say. This person is amazing to jam with because they're like at this level or this person is probably not great to jam with for the same reason, but I don't want it to be from a level of egotism. You know I want it to be a respect in a humility thing where people aren't using it just to show off their just I don't know like like I think about the dojo and I think about like US general rankings it's like when you hear a title from as a lower class to an upper class. There is like an instant recognition of respect there's like a hierarchy and I'm trying to figure out how to do it in a way that's not also like an MLM, but where like the qualifications for different levels are like instantly recognizable and it's easy to say like you know this person has put like 10,000 hours in so it's not just a level of like I don't know you know like it. It's it's generalized enough that you could tell that they have a good ear just from like a title you could like trust them without ever having played with them and I feel like there's a lot of places where that's a proprietary thing like Berkeley, but it would be cool to make it like something that you could just achieve like you can get tested for you know and like the other part I wonder about is if it should the whole thing shouldn't just be like nonprofit or not for profit at least you know like as an incubator taking a cut but when they grow out of it, just letting it go or basically saying like while you're in the incubation doing recording and gigs and stuff as part of like the incubation process but also like learning how to get your own gigs and create them and stuff like that you know like while they're working they get they teach they get paid they get insurance benefits, and all that kind of stuff and we treat them well but I don't know like I really like the idea of someone who like graduates from it having that degree of respective like oh shit, you know making it hard enough that people have to go through stuff to get it and that when they graduated with it, you know it's it's almost guaranteed that someone that's like I don't know like a level 10 musician is going to be making like hundreds of thousands of dollars where it's like someone it's like I want to create that career ladder, but I think it's also like I'm trying to monopolized the process of it to make it like I don't know to get more clarity to it. I hate that it's so ambiguous and so like dependent. It's like you have to pay a shit ton for it to be a guarantee and I would rather it be something that like you pay by working on it you know like you're giving the tools to go get your own students you earned degrees by recording and having a certain number of students and having like, is that the other like, but also having like that level of proficiency where you could play with like fucking whoever, but that you know the language well enough that you can communicate with everyone else especially anyone that's been to the program like I kind of dream of a world where people who've been through it get a consistent experience like anyone that's like a level five that plays with another level five is gonna have a consistent experience where it's like same with like a level 10 you know like creative creatively they'll be able to do whatever the hell they want, but they'll get a consistent experience of I guess like similar Joy and similar frustrations of. Oh yeah I can't do this yet. I can't do this yet I'm you know stuff like that. You know like I just hate that the music industries run by so many people that don't give a shit about the music and I want to change that you know I wanna make a standard that creates real music for real people and that people that come out of here have the ability to make that they don't get stuck like with so many people that I know that with the situations that I know so many people have been through where it's like I can't book my own gigs. I can't mark it myself. I can't write my songs or whatever like the whole idea of the processes to force you into that creative space you know force you kind of in the artist way and stuff, but also force you in defining the things that make it sustainable. But the most important part of it all is doing it in a way that the spirit and journey to mastery is never lost


The additional benefit of a system like this as it makes it easier to advertise to businesses you know like restaurants have like a five star system or a Michelin star system bands have nothing like that and musicians, especially have nothing like that so like a lot of times when people are trying to hire musicians, it's almost a craft shit or it's a word-of-mouth thing like it in there needs to be a way of being able to say like oh this musician is you know X quality so they're going to do a good job here maybe that's a wave I don't know if that's even something that they worry about, but I think it's like an additional selling point of like yeah if we're giving you a band where all the musicians are like you know of this quality then you you're guaranteed you're gonna have a good time and like you know if you put like equipment in there that creates just like kind of the standard saying then it just becomes so much easier to like expect a certain level of quality. I don't know. Maybe they don't care about that as much but I definitely care about it and it's almost like it creates an easier way to like move up a ranking system if if you could say hey, I've got this thing and it's it's a marketing thing more than anything and like I think when I'm thinking about all this stuff it's it's like I'm starting to understand that it's it's up to creative division how the world could look and and to build that world and like right now I think that's what I'm trying to do is a vision like what do I want the future to look like I wanted it to be easier to get good music in real places you know to get real live experiences especially for people just you know booking people for the first time or you know stuff like that I just want to make it easier to get live music everywhere but also to increase the quality of live music everywhere so that way like you know with all this fucking artificial intelligence stuff there's like an alternative that comes back for like real experiences and it's like if we can build it in this way that also shows like hey you know with better tears of music you make more money that's huge like I feel like the whole world at least all of America benefits from adopting that kind of assistant maybe like the only people I could see it being harder on is like beginning musicians, but we're offering a solution to that too. I don't know it's it's it's a food for thought kind of thing, but I don't another thing. I'm coming back to you is like when I think about you know building better musicians, and stuff like that. I feel like that the requirements to understand like what each you know level rank or degree comes with is a matter of I don't know, like talking to people in the different levels of each industry and seeing what are the common comment traits that they look for when playing with someone using like building blocks to get people there too thought


Another thought that keeps crossing my right mind right now is why? Like I look at I guess all this stuff and I wonder how much of it is just me trying to fix my past and is that like a meaningful way to create a future because it's like when I think about building all this stuff the things that come up in my mind are all the ways I was treated in the past you know with Matt Howell middle school and I almost feels like I'm trying to solve that and when I start thinking about that way, it makes me wanna cry and I wonder how much of what I'm trying to do with drums and with life is tied to trying to solve the past you know, solve the pains I felt and it's like would I be doing all this if it wasn't for that, and if it wasn't for that, what else would I be doing and that's kind of where I'm like confused cause it's like I don't know. Some part of me feels like I'm trying to create these standards to feel better than people you know to have like a quantitative score to be like I don't know. I guess I deserve better gigs. I feel like this happens all the time where it's like I come up with this idea and then I get to a point where I start talking myself out of it like I get all excited about it and then something sets in it's like well. Why do that you know I start to get the doubt I start to wonder what it is and it's like this situation it's like a very real thing of like maybe maybe I'm doing all this just to resolve the past and I mean I guess there's one part of me that's like you know so what if I am but I don't know. It's like I don't know or even just makes sense in the past in a way it's kind of scary you know like I do think I'm trying to give the world something that I didn't get it. It makes me feel like you know the whole you try to save the world when you're the one that needs help. It's like what if that's all this is. Is it a bad thing if that's all it is it's like I don't know. I really don't like there's some part of it that it feels like, but yeah, I am trying to make it less ambiguous. I'm trying to create an easier path for artists to grow like I am genuinely trying to do all those things, but it is also like I feel like now that I'm not after fame it's like what is the next form of achievement it's like there aren't really any definitions of it. success at this point is just a matter of getting the right gigs getting the right people you know getting the right business put together. I'm trying to make that easier not just for me but for other people like to say like hey if we're we can grow a kind of like drum place and eventually other kinds of places too I don't know I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't know, though. I guess it's like would I be trying to do this if I wasn't trying to resolve the past too you know like am I only doing this to resolve the past and I think like what I keep coming to is like I feel like this happens all the time now where it's like I come up with a good idea and then I realize it's just to externally resolve something that you know only I'm going through or that only I've been through and then it comes time to do something about it and it's like well this was always for me like it of course it doesn't work. It wasn't for anyone else it was to resolve my past and then you know I get to that point where I understand that it's just a point of resolving my past and then I'm like OK well, let me just mentally deal with it and then it's like after that the idea it feels like it goes away because it's like OK well, I'm no longer painted by that thing and it makes me wonder if like I don't know if like all pain is just a business idea if dealing with my pain is actually making it harder to start something which is a really weird thing to think about you know if I would've been successful if I was just in more pain or or dealing with something and found a way to save the world using it. It's kind of funny to think about it that way, but I mean it is something on genuinely thinking about not that I would stop doing it. It's just what if that's all it is what if what if everything I come up with without input is just that you know what if I don't actually understand what anyone else wants or needs or anything which is very likely cause I haven't really asked.

I feel so much anxiety right now and I'm realizing I should talk about this more with people instead of just like saving it for journaling and notes or whatever but I do still feel anxiety fairly frequently but today I'm kind of feeling it because I'm realizing I don't know some conflicting things in my mind with the business is like I somehow wanna make it for like an exclusive experience that makes a lot of money, but I also want to make it for everyone and I think in viewing it in that light I'm starting to see the differences between like financial scales you know so for instance, like the difference between like Berkeley and like music and arts is that music and ours is for everyone in Berkeley is for like the elite that can afford it and like doing that comparison, it's like what am I really trying to build here? Am I trying to build something that is for people that can afford it or for everyone and I think I go back to over and over this idea that what I'm trying to build as a pathway for people like me, but I feel like over and over I've heard you know don't sell a mediocre. Don't sell the average and it almost feels like that's what I would be trying to do. It's so like my confusion now is like who am I trying to sell to? Who is it for and what is what is it that I'm doing because I still think what I'm trying to do is get like I think building paths for teaching lessons and you know getting gigs and stuff like that is great but it's like what what is who's it for you know and it's like that kind of question. Makes me wonder like you know who is writing the curriculum visit people are the people that come in writing their own curriculum or is there a curriculum by the school for pumping out great people or you know what is it because I think it's like it feels like if the goal is to find and create exceptional musicians then there should be a set curriculum like a system that grows them, but if the business is giving musicians an opportunity to grow themselves and teach giving them the tools to do so then it's almost like a create your own curriculum and have added it you know it and you know, improve your own curriculum and stuff like that and it's like one of those things that I feel like I just have to make a decision


The good thing is that the past kind of diverge, depending on what the route is, I want to take you know if I'm focused on like exclusive experiences. It should be about one on one training at a premium. It should be like a second curriculum up until a certain point it should be about you know like giving exclusive experiences that you would be able to get anywhere else so showing up at your house, teaching you everything about it even offering to do other services with the stuff like that whereas if it's for everyone, it feels like it the better route is to go towards something like group classes, and accessibility and cheaper equipment and stuff like that and I think it's a matter of like which I feel like I want to do and who I wanna serve in that regard and it's complicated you know because I feel like when I when I try to think about the marketing side of things, I am my own demographic for this like I am someone that I would've helped with this and I don't know if I would've been a client or an employee and you know if those are even separate things like you know like the service of the demographic model or the central demographic model. It feels like it would be different for the students then it would be for the teachers you know we're looking for teachers that are already high-quality and want to improve themselves further and further, but on the other end, we're looking for students that don't necessarily have to pay a lot, but get a lot out of it. I don't know like it. It's a weird thing thing is I'm leaning towards the higher paying side of it because I do would much rather create an exclusive experience because it seems like everyone else else's doing the opposite. Everyone else is going for everyone or even just the average, but that almost feels like it's betraying who I was which isn't even necessarily true.

So I need to do a dump right now. Tryingt o organize my days again and it's once again coming to this point where I feel like I'm doing way too many things at once. balancing way too much like if i look at all thats accomplishable in a day i almost feel this like disdain for what needs to be done the discipline thats required of me to do things that see no results to go through each day with like nothing to show for with no results and to constantly be stuck at this point of indecision on what to prioritize like its driving me fucking carazy the indecision because theres pros and cons for every side and i just wish i had someone else taking the reigns here i wish i had someone else to guide me because idk i feel like i come to a conclusion about something like, for instance, exercise where my priorities are supposed to be sleep then food then exercise and meditation then practice but when i structure life like that nothing moves nothing goes anywhere i stay exactly where i am and thats the point im frustrated about is that im entering a period where i want to be more effective with that time because im afraid of how slowly im moving im afraid taht even when im beginning to grow faster im still so slow and that what im doing now has nothing to show for like im sat at a crossroads right now where ihave an hour left of dilligent time an hour before i need to chill out and reward myself but i spent three hours fucking around after work watching tv eating sleeping masturbating and its just this part of my routine which absolutely drains my time like imagine if i had three more hours today imagine what i couldve gotten done and is that the ADHD talking or is that truth its like a priority thing but its also like anger and frustration and energy likfe i keep telling myself that i didn't have energy in the moment to do anything about it but that pisses me off because they dont have energy in war they dont have energy in the office they survive on a constant fight or flight even a monk will practice disciplined for days at a time i feel like im living life backwards and like im constantly still a slave to my circumstances like today i cowarded out of the jamm session for jazz and its like i see the wall i see the barrier the terror that comes from trying to do things the reason im alwas stuck right here but i dont know what to do about any of it i dont know how to prioritize those things more effectively especially when all i want is accomplishment because i think about what the greats say about losing sleep about giving it your all constant playing obsession and obsession and obsession and i worry that im not good enough to be that person that im faulting myself for even tryibng and that im trying to be amazing at way too many things at once like trying to run a marathon it just feels instead like im constantly failing msyelf over and over and over and over again like my idea of recreation is skewed towards mindlessness and that my need for mindlessness and dopamine is causing me so much pain like i feel like over the past tow years ive genuinely learned that after a certain point there is a wall that gets hit where if i try to force myself to do anything after that point it ruins the next day and the next day but i feel like there are people more disciplined than me doing more than me but arent complaining about it theyre just doing ti like if i didn't have to nap in the middle of the day after fucking starbucks then i could practice more or if i didn't have to stop two hours before bed i could practice more like thats 5 more hours in the day that i could be exercising or practicing or working on business thats just spent fucking mucking around doing nothing draining my soul of anything and i feel liketheres this narrative in my mind that i need to take thos ebbreaks but i dont really know if thats true they feel like bad habits but even this talking about it complaining about it....I COULD BE FUCKING DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. and im not im just sitting around fucking complaining that i have no time to do anything 

and it feels like the part of it thats the most fucking frustrating is that the learning process is way too fucking difficult to systemitize and
