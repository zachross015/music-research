# 12-08-2025

Love this -- I built you a **practical, research-backed, belt-by-belt
requirements list** so your Dojo actually _guarantees_graduates are
gig-/recording-/teaching-ready. I pulled benchmark criteria from
national music-education standards (NAfME), conservatory/percussion
audition expectations, published exam syllabi (ABRSM), and real-world
session/ensemble guidance so the requirements are measurable,
defensible, and aligned with what schools, studios, and employers
expect.
([NAfME](https://nafme.org/publications-resources/standards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Below is the full checklist, organized by belt level and by skill
domain. Use these as pass/fail criteria for grading students at each
belt. Each item is written so you can turn it into a rubric or a
short video test.

* * *

# How to use this

1. For each belt, require **demonstrations** (video or live) for
every item marked with **(demo)**.

2. Use **metronome + backing tracks** for timing tests.

3. Maintain a practice log + teacher observation notes for
"character/professional" items.

4. Students must pass _all_ core domains (Technique, Time, Reading,
Ensemble, Professional) to advance -- partial passes allowed for
elective domains (creativity, recording) depending on how strict you
want to be.
* * *

# Domains (applied in every belt)

- **Technique** (rudiments, mechanics, tone control)
- **Time & Feel** (subdivision, pocket, tempo stability)
- **Reading & Sight-reading** (notation, sight reading accuracy)
- **Repertoire & Transcription** (songs prepared & transcribed)
- **Style & Vocabulary** (genre fluency)
- **Creativity / Improvisation / Composition**
- **Ear Training / Aural Skills** (intervals, rhythms, harmonic
  hearing)
- **Ensemble Skills** (listening, dynamics, cueing, following
  conductor/leader)
- **Professional Skills / Recording / Teaching** (punctuality,
  communication, studio basics, lesson delivery)
* * *

**To graduate to Black Belt, student must pass all core domains and
produce portfolio evidence.** Requirements (each **must have**
documentation or live demo):

### Core Musical Mastery

- Technique: master full rudiment tree (drummers) or equivalent
  virtuosity for the instrument; clean, repeatable execution at
performance speeds. **(demo video + teacher signoff)**
- Time & Feel: play with click and human band interchangeably;

  including fills, cymbal/ornamentation, and dynamic shading; submit
notated charts. **(work sample)**

### Ensemble & Leadership

- Ensemble: demonstrate leadership as musical director for a full
  60--90 minute live set and produce a positive critique from at
least two outside professionals (local bandleader, teacher, or
producer). **(documented gig + references)**
- Communication: demonstrate clear on-stage and in-studio cueing,
  ability to take direction from producers/conductors and give
direction to other musicians with professional language. **(demo)**

### Recording & Studio

- Studio: have documented participation in **at least 3** studio
  sessions (could be in-house dojo recordings). Must demonstrate
proper use of click, ability to record multiple takes, comping and
overdub etiquette, and deliver takes on time. **(session logs +
reference)**
- DAW: basic editing (trim, fade, align), export stems, and prepare a
  session for mixing. **(demo)**

### Teaching & Pedagogy

- Teaching: prepare and deliver a **full curriculum** for White→Green
  (beginner→intermediate) including lesson plans, assessment rubrics,
and a portfolio of student progress for at least two students taught
over 3 months. **(lesson docs + student testimonials)**
- Assessment: create and administer a 30-minute practical exam for
  lower belts and grade them reliably. **(rubric + scored exams)**

### Professionalism & Career

- Gigs: documentary evidence of **≥20 paid gigs** (mix of small and
  large venues) OR a combination of 10 paid gigs + 3 recorded credits
on commercially released tracks. **(invoices/credits)**
- References: 2 professional references (producer, venue manager,
  teacher) vouching for punctuality, reliability, and adaptability.
- Portfolio: press kit (bio, headshot, 3 recordings, repertoire list,
  contact) ready to present to promoters/agents.

**If all above are met → Black Belt awarded.** Graduates must sign a
Dojo Alumni Code: commit to mentoring lower belts and upholding Dojo
standards.

Rationale: these requirements mirror what conservatory auditions,
session work, and professional ensemble leadership expect --
combining technical mastery, sight-reading, studio experience,
teaching ability, and documented professional history. ([University

# Quick notes on assessment, evidence, and fairness

- **Rubrics:** turn each requirement into a 0--4 rubric (0 = not met,
  4 = professional standard). Use teacher signoff + recordings. (See
NAfME performance rubrics for structure.)
([NAfME](https://nafme.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2014-Music-Standards-Ensemble-Strand.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **External validation:** require at least one outside examiner
  (visiting pro or conservatory teacher) for Brown→Black promotions
to remove bias. (Common practice in conservatory juries.) ([Curtis
Institute of
Music](https://www.curtis.edu/apply/audition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Portfolio approach:** maintain student folders (recordings,
  transcriptions, lesson plans, gig logs). This is critical for both
job placement and Conservatory applications. ([Percussive Arts
Society](https://pas.org/pas-blog/the-12-step-college-audition-process/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
* * *

# Implementation suggestions (fast wins)

1. **Create video test templates** for each belt (30--90s clips for
specific items).

2. **Make a printable rubric** per domain for teachers to complete at
each grading.

3. **Run quarterly 'grading' events** (like belt tests) where
students demonstrate in-person/recorded items and receive feedback.

4. **Set up an in-house "session room"** to run mock studio sessions;
require Brown+ to log session hours in that room.

5. **Partner with local schools/choirs** for ensemble work and with
one local producer for studio credits -- accelerates portfolio
building.
* * *

If you want, I'll:

- convert this into a **printable checklist** (PDF) for student
  folders,
- build **rubric tables** (teacher friendly) for each belt, or
- produce **video test scripts** (what to record and how to present
  it).

Which next deliverable would you like first?

Great -- I dug into conservatory audition specs, Percussive Arts
Society curricula, ABRSM's drum-kit grades, Berklee's drum set
coursework, pro session guides, and studio prep checklists, and used
those to **tighten and validate** the Dan system so every Dan has
measurable, research-backed thresholds across your six categories:
**Time, Sound, Technique, Dynamics, Groove, Musicality** -- plus
clear, professional evidence (gigs, studio credits, teaching
records). Below is the upgraded, research-grounded Dan syllabus and
assessment plan.

I'll (1) summarize the research anchors so you see where requirements
came from, (2) present each Dan level with _concrete, testable
requirements_ for the six categories and professional milestones, and
(3) give implementation notes (external validation, rubrics,
evidence). I cite the heaviest sources after the key statements so
you can follow up.

* * *

## Research anchors (why these requirements)

- University/percussion audition documents and conservatory curricula
  define what "performance-ready" means (repertoire volume,
sight-reading, multi-style competency, and proof via auditions).
These informed the repertoire, sight-reading, and ensemble standards.
([University of
Redlands](https://www.redlands.edu/globalassets/admissions--aid/music-admissions/conservatory-of-music---percussion-audition-requirements.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Percussive Arts Society articles & PAS curriculum studies outline
  national percussion objectives and sequencing for drumset in
academic programs -- used to validate progressive technical and
ensemble milestones. ([Percussive Arts
Society](https://pas.org/publication-articles/standards-based-curricula-in-applied-percussion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Berklee Online & Berklee course listings show typical college-level
  drum-set learning outcomes: coordination, feel, repertoire,
Afro-Cuban and shuffle studies, and practical studio skills -- used
to set tempo ranges, style list, and DAW familiarity. ([Berklee
Online](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/drum-set-performance-101?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- ABRSM Drum Kit syllabus gives a graded framework for repertoire,
  technical tests and sight-reading which helped shape precise
performance metrics.
([abrsm.org](https://www.abrsm.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/Performance%20Grades%20Qual%20Spec%20-%20Drum%20Kit%202024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Pro-session / studio checklists (Yamaha, studio blogs) provided the
  real-world studio and session expectations (prep, click use,
ability to deliver takes, mic & take etiquette). ([Yamaha
Music](https://hub.yamaha.com/drums/d-how-to/how-to-become-a-great-session-drummer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Upgraded DAN SYSTEM -- Drumset (research-backed, measurable)

General rules for grading all Dan levels:

- Use the six categories as **core rubrics**. Each item scored 0--4
  (0 = not attempted, 4 = pro standard). Passing a Dan requires
average ≥3.0 across all six categories and meeting **professional
milestone** thresholds (gigs/studio/teaching) for that Dan.
- Evidence types: live audition, recorded demos (raw takes + stems),
  lesson plans & student progress, gig invoices, producer/venue
references, external juror letter.
- Brown/Red/Black previously now map to Dan 1--3 for professional
  levels and Dan 4--5 for mastery/lineage.

* * *

## Assessment & Implementation (concrete next steps)

1. **Rubrics:** build 6-category rubrics (Time, Sound, Technique,
Dynamics, Groove, Musicality) with 0--4 scales and explicit evidence
prompts. Example for _Time_: 4 = ±0.5 bpm over 3 min + successful
mute-click test; 3 = ±1.0 bpm; etc.

2. **External jurors:** require outside juror signoffs for Dan 2→3
and 3→4 promotions (conservatory/jury model). This prevents internal
grade inflation. (ABRSM/conservatory practice.)
([abrsm.org](https://www.abrsm.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/Performance%20Grades%20Qual%20Spec%20-%20Drum%20Kit%202024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. **Portfolio system:** digital student folders (stems, clips, gig
invoices, lesson plans) -- required for Dan assessments.

4. **Partnerships:** form relationships with a local producer,
venue(s), and at least one university percussion program for guest
jurors and studio opportunities (based on PAS & Berklee industry
integration models). ([Percussive Arts
Society](https://pas.org/publication-articles/drumset-in-the-university-percussion-curriculum/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5. **Mock sessions & audits:** create a staffed "session room" for
in-house graded recording sessions (required evidence for Dan 1--3).
Use studio checklist (prep, click, mic etiquette) for evaluation.
([Drum Audio
Editing](https://www.drumaudioediting.com/post/6-step-pre-studio-checklist?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

6. **Continuing education:** require Dan holders to re-certify or
present annual clinics to maintain standards. This preserves the dojo
lineage and ensures ongoing relevance.

## Quick deliverables I can produce next (pick one or more)

- Printable 6-category Dan rubric pack (PDF) for Den 1→5 (teacher &
  student versions).
- Sample external juror letter / checklist template for Dan
  promotions.
- A 1-page "evidence checklist" for students to collect (gig log,
  session logs, stems, references).
- Visual Dan chart (infographic) ready for printing or website.

Which deliverable do you want first? Or would you like me to
**generate the 6-category rubric PDFs** for Dan 1→3 immediately?

It seems like everywhere with a ranking is both taken more seriously
and easier to transcend. Eg marathon vs 5k, army rank, dojo belt, etc

Grants for emerging artists from incubators, good idea to tap into.

Jojo idea actually seems super obvious I guess and I don't really
know how to start planning it though like I guess the basic idea even
if it's not a dojo or instead like I don't know like a Marine Corps
or something I feel like the verbiage on that needs to be fine-tunes
to attract like discipline people, but the idea of it should be that
it's about kind of crafting people into some musicians where like the
requirements need to be less about I don't know. I guess the quick
path it needs to be less about the quick path, the easy path and more
about the long-term in the same way that like becoming a monk or
becoming like a tae kwon do master or you know anything like that
it's about when you're in the dojo, gaining a basic proficiency over
the instrument and then when you go beyond the dojo, it's about not
only the proficiency of the instrument, but the strategies that the
proficiency is used in and it goes from being a band member to a band
leader to a I don't know like a band coordinator or something like
that leads multiple bands to being in charge of the person that leads
multiple bands it kind of going up that hierarchy and it seems like
every tier should have like a panel judges in a test to pass that
tier and the panel of judges have to reach a consensus, whether or
not they meet the requirements which I guess it's kind of a college
is due already and also to pay for like the kind of test, but it's
something like I wanna be legitimate with you know not just like
pumping out mediocre musicians, but like I want someone who comes to
the school and leaves it to be trained, not only in like technical
proficiency, but also the art of like being a good musician you know
showing up on time being generous with how you play and playing for
the music not for yourself and stuff like that like I don't want
people being able to leave the school as like egoists and I want the
leads to be the people that continue to come through the school in
our incubator through it and stuff like that I don't know. I guess it
makes it worse studying like martial arts system stuff like that you
know something that has like a general or a genuine or hierarchy to
it so tired I have way too much caffeine this weekend not nearly
enough water not great food. I'm feeling the effects of it but like
I'm genuinely excited about this idea, I feel like this could
actually work. He's gonna apply as much to like students as it does
adults or teach group kids as much as it does adults there's still
like I think a lot of specifics that need to be hammered out, but
it's like a self feeding system too like you can raise someone and
then they become the people that teach their that's the long-term


But I think the reason it would work so well because like you could
reasonably create the same level progression that someone had in
something like rock band and it's like if you use the dojo for basic
proficiency and use like the incubation as things outside of it, then
you could really create like a meaningful way to grow musicians that
is it just go to school for it like it. I think it creates an even
better alternative to having to go to like an expensive college
because you get paid for it you know if you're going to the dojo and
you work there then it reasonably what it should do is create like a
skill path that teaches you how to succeed and to build your own
opportunities in a manage people and stuff like that I had something
else there too it was

I really want is for higher ranks to have a higher level of respect
just at the offset like someone sees someone that's like a you know
past the introductory levels like sees them as like a rank five or
something it's just instant recognition or not even fame, but just
instant respect for their ability to play you know I want there to be
like a quality of standard where people can say. This person is
amazing to jam with because they're like at this level or this person
is probably not great to jam with for the same reason, but I don't
want it to be from a level of egotism. You know I want it to be a
respect in a humility thing where people aren't using it just to show
off their just I don't know like like I think about the dojo and I
think about like US general rankings it's like when you hear a title
from as a lower class to an upper class. There is like an instant
recognition of respect there's like a hierarchy and I'm trying to
figure out how to do it in a way that's not also like an MLM, but
where like the qualifications for different levels are like instantly
recognizable and it's easy to say like you know this person has put
like 10,000 hours in so it's not just a level of like I don't know
you know like it. It's it's generalized enough that you could tell
that they have a good ear just from like a title you could like trust
them without ever having played with them and I feel like there's a
lot of places where that's a proprietary thing like Berkeley, but it
would be cool to make it like something that you could just achieve
like you can get tested for you know and like the other part I wonder
about is if it should the whole thing shouldn't just be like
nonprofit or not for profit at least you know like as an incubator
taking a cut but when they grow out of it, just letting it go or
basically saying like while you're in the incubation doing recording
and gigs and stuff as part of like the incubation process but also
like learning how to get your own gigs and create them and stuff like
that you know like while they're working they get they teach they get
paid they get insurance benefits, and all that kind of stuff and we
treat them well but I don't know like I really like the idea of
someone who like graduates from it having that degree of respective
like oh shit, you know making it hard enough that people have to go
through stuff to get it and that when they graduated with it, you
know it's it's almost guaranteed that someone that's like I don't
know like a level 10 musician is going to be making like hundreds of
thousands of dollars where it's like someone it's like I want to
create that career ladder, but I think it's also like I'm trying to
monopolized the process of it to make it like I don't know to get
more clarity to it. I hate that it's so ambiguous and so like
dependent. It's like you have to pay a shit ton for it to be a
guarantee and I would rather it be something that like you pay by
working on it you know like you're giving the tools to go get your
own students you earned degrees by recording and having a certain
number of students and having like, is that the other like, but also
having like that level of proficiency where you could play with like
fucking whoever, but that you know the language well enough that you
can communicate with everyone else especially anyone that's been to
the program like I kind of dream of a world where people who've been
through it get a consistent experience like anyone that's like a
level five that plays with another level five is gonna have a
consistent experience where it's like same with like a level 10 you
know like creative creatively they'll be able to do whatever the hell
they want, but they'll get a consistent experience of I guess like
similar Joy and similar frustrations of. Oh yeah I can't do this yet.
I can't do this yet I'm you know stuff like that. You know like I
just hate that the music industries run by so many people that don't
give a shit about the music and I want to change that you know I
wanna make a standard that creates real music for real people and
that people that come out of here have the ability to make that they
don't get stuck like with so many people that I know that with the
situations that I know so many people have been through where it's
like I can't book my own gigs. I can't mark it myself. I can't write
my songs or whatever like the whole idea of the processes to force
you into that creative space you know force you kind of in the artist
way and stuff, but also force you in defining the things that make it
sustainable. But the most important part of it all is doing it in a
way that the spirit and journey to mastery is never lost


The additional benefit of a system like this as it makes it easier to
advertise to businesses you know like restaurants have like a five
star system or a Michelin star system bands have nothing like that
and musicians, especially have nothing like that so like a lot of
times when people are trying to hire musicians, it's almost a craft
shit or it's a word-of-mouth thing like it in there needs to be a way
of being able to say like oh this musician is you know X quality so
they're going to do a good job here maybe that's a wave I don't know
if that's even something that they worry about, but I think it's like
an additional selling point of like yeah if we're giving you a band
where all the musicians are like you know of this quality then you
you're guaranteed you're gonna have a good time and like you know if
you put like equipment in there that creates just like kind of the
standard saying then it just becomes so much easier to like expect a
certain level of quality. I don't know. Maybe they don't care about
that as much but I definitely care about it and it's almost like it
creates an easier way to like move up a ranking system if if you
could say hey, I've got this thing and it's it's a marketing thing
more than anything and like I think when I'm thinking about all this
stuff it's it's like I'm starting to understand that it's it's up to
creative division how the world could look and and to build that
world and like right now I think that's what I'm trying to do is a
vision like what do I want the future to look like I wanted it to be
easier to get good music in real places you know to get real live
experiences especially for people just you know booking people for
the first time or you know stuff like that I just want to make it
easier to get live music everywhere but also to increase the quality
of live music everywhere so that way like you know with all this
fucking artificial intelligence stuff there's like an alternative
that comes back for like real experiences and it's like if we can
build it in this way that also shows like hey you know with better
tears of music you make more money that's huge like I feel like the
whole world at least all of America benefits from adopting that kind
of assistant maybe like the only people I could see it being harder
on is like beginning musicians, but we're offering a solution to that
too. I don't know it's it's it's a food for thought kind of thing,
but I don't another thing. I'm coming back to you is like when I
think about you know building better musicians, and stuff like that.
I feel like that the requirements to understand like what each you
know level rank or degree comes with is a matter of I don't know,
like talking to people in the different levels of each industry and
seeing what are the common comment traits that they look for when
playing with someone using like building blocks to get people there
too thought


Another thought that keeps crossing my right mind right now is why?
Like I look at I guess all this stuff and I wonder how much of it is
just me trying to fix my past and is that like a meaningful way to
create a future because it's like when I think about building all
this stuff the things that come up in my mind are all the ways I was
treated in the past you know with Matt Howell middle school and I
almost feels like I'm trying to solve that and when I start thinking
about that way, it makes me wanna cry and I wonder how much of what
I'm trying to do with drums and with life is tied to trying to solve
the past you know, solve the pains I felt and it's like would I be
doing all this if it wasn't for that, and if it wasn't for that, what
else would I be doing and that's kind of where I'm like confused
cause it's like I don't know. Some part of me feels like I'm trying
to create these standards to feel better than people you know to have
like a quantitative score to be like I don't know. I guess I deserve
better gigs. I feel like this happens all the time where it's like I
come up with this idea and then I get to a point where I start
talking myself out of it like I get all excited about it and then
something sets in it's like well. Why do that you know I start to get
the doubt I start to wonder what it is and it's like this situation
it's like a very real thing of like maybe maybe I'm doing all this
just to resolve the past and I mean I guess there's one part of me
that's like you know so what if I am but I don't know. It's like I
don't know or even just makes sense in the past in a way it's kind of
scary you know like I do think I'm trying to give the world something
that I didn't get it. It makes me feel like you know the whole you
try to save the world when you're the one that needs help. It's like
what if that's all this is. Is it a bad thing if that's all it is
it's like I don't know. I really don't like there's some part of it
that it feels like, but yeah, I am trying to make it less ambiguous.
I'm trying to create an easier path for artists to grow like I am
genuinely trying to do all those things, but it is also like I feel
like now that I'm not after fame it's like what is the next form of
achievement it's like there aren't really any definitions of it.
success at this point is just a matter of getting the right gigs
getting the right people you know getting the right business put
together. I'm trying to make that easier not just for me but for
other people like to say like hey if we're we can grow a kind of like
drum place and eventually other kinds of places too I don't know I
don't think it's a bad thing. I don't know, though. I guess it's like
would I be trying to do this if I wasn't trying to resolve the past
too you know like am I only doing this to resolve the past and I
think like what I keep coming to is like I feel like this happens all
the time now where it's like I come up with a good idea and then I
realize it's just to externally resolve something that you know only
I'm going through or that only I've been through and then it comes
time to do something about it and it's like well this was always for
me like it of course it doesn't work. It wasn't for anyone else it
was to resolve my past and then you know I get to that point where I
understand that it's just a point of resolving my past and then I'm
like OK well, let me just mentally deal with it and then it's like
after that the idea it feels like it goes away because it's like OK
well, I'm no longer painted by that thing and it makes me wonder if
like I don't know if like all pain is just a business idea if dealing
with my pain is actually making it harder to start something which is
a really weird thing to think about you know if I would've been
successful if I was just in more pain or or dealing with something
and found a way to save the world using it. It's kind of funny to
think about it that way, but I mean it is something on genuinely
thinking about not that I would stop doing it. It's just what if
that's all it is what if what if everything I come up with without
input is just that you know what if I don't actually understand what
anyone else wants or needs or anything which is very likely cause I
haven't really asked.

I feel so much anxiety right now and I'm realizing I should talk
about this more with people instead of just like saving it for
journaling and notes or whatever but I do still feel anxiety fairly
frequently but today I'm kind of feeling it because I'm realizing I
don't know some conflicting things in my mind with the business is
like I somehow wanna make it for like an exclusive experience that
makes a lot of money, but I also want to make it for everyone and I
think in viewing it in that light I'm starting to see the differences
between like financial scales you know so for instance, like the
difference between like Berkeley and like music and arts is that
music and ours is for everyone in Berkeley is for like the elite that
can afford it and like doing that comparison, it's like what am I
really trying to build here? Am I trying to build something that is
for people that can afford it or for everyone and I think I go back
to over and over this idea that what I'm trying to build as a pathway
for people like me, but I feel like over and over I've heard you know
don't sell a mediocre. Don't sell the average and it almost feels
like that's what I would be trying to do. It's so like my confusion
now is like who am I trying to sell to? Who is it for and what is
what is it that I'm doing because I still think what I'm trying to do
is get like I think building paths for teaching lessons and you know
getting gigs and stuff like that is great but it's like what what is
who's it for you know and it's like that kind of question. Makes me
wonder like you know who is writing the curriculum visit people are
the people that come in writing their own curriculum or is there a
curriculum by the school for pumping out great people or you know
what is it because I think it's like it feels like if the goal is to
find and create exceptional musicians then there should be a set
curriculum like a system that grows them, but if the business is
giving musicians an opportunity to grow themselves and teach giving
them the tools to do so then it's almost like a create your own
curriculum and have added it you know it and you know, improve your
own curriculum and stuff like that and it's like one of those things
that I feel like I just have to make a decision


The good thing is that the past kind of diverge, depending on what
the route is, I want to take you know if I'm focused on like
exclusive experiences. It should be about one on one training at a
premium. It should be like a second curriculum up until a certain
point it should be about you know like giving exclusive experiences
that you would be able to get anywhere else so showing up at your
house, teaching you everything about it even offering to do other
services with the stuff like that whereas if it's for everyone, it
feels like it the better route is to go towards something like group
classes, and accessibility and cheaper equipment and stuff like that
and I think it's a matter of like which I feel like I want to do and
who I wanna serve in that regard and it's complicated you know
because I feel like when I when I try to think about the marketing
side of things, I am my own demographic for this like I am someone
that I would've helped with this and I don't know if I would've been
a client or an employee and you know if those are even separate
things like you know like the service of the demographic model or the
central demographic model. It feels like it would be different for
the students then it would be for the teachers you know we're looking
for teachers that are already high-quality and want to improve
themselves further and further, but on the other end, we're looking
for students that don't necessarily have to pay a lot, but get a lot
out of it. I don't know like it. It's a weird thing thing is I'm
leaning towards the higher paying side of it because I do would much
rather create an exclusive experience because it seems like everyone
else else's doing the opposite. Everyone else is going for everyone
or even just the average, but that almost feels like it's betraying
who I was which isn't even necessarily true.

# 12-09-2025

After my run, I was like looking forward to practicing, but it's six
and I'm now sitting at this crossroads of Dubai betrayed practice for
routine which I've never really done or do I betray routine for
practice which I think is what I've always done. It's hard to tell
what's the disciplined route here.

I feel like I'd know deep down that the more important route for what
I'm aiming to do in building like routine and building structure is
to not practice and to cook dinner and get ready for bed. That way
tomorrow can be a new start, but also kind of hate that cause it
feels like I'm like neglecting practice cause I only got like an hour
in today. And even then it felt infected because I didn't really have
a game plan. I feel like at least for right now. I need to go back to
the paper method of logging practice because the computer method is
kind of broken and I need to brainstorm new ways to go about it. I
also just feel like I was more intentional when I did things that
way. But that being said, I definitely feel like I need a stronger
system for improving at this stage.

What do you think it comes down to is? I'm trying to find a more
effective wage to learn music to have a kind of like scaffolding
system that makes it easier to learn more songs quicker and to say
like this is the degree to which I wanna learn XYZ.

I think I'm just anxious to have guarantees and evidence of going the
right way. That I'm continuing to learn and grow in drums. I'm trying
to create systems that not only make it happen faster, but also make
it easier to be more disciplined. One idea: chunk and mastery?
Quantify each chunk (and song) on transcribing, learning, memorizing?
Also need to acknowledge the things I have learned I think. Feel like
there needs to be another intermediary category? It's usually
difficult because it's like one bar that will be difficult. And need
to keep in mind that the purpose of all of this is to implement, so
step beyond memorizing is slipping the difficult vocabulary into
jams. It's something I slacked on out of change of requirements. Idk,
I feel anxious and I feel like I'm just trying to solve it. I wish I
had more time to practice. I wish I'd be more diligent and
disciplined in practice.

Done torchering mswlf now

What I desperately need is a way to record and place back myself from
directly on the throne like in a way that I don't have to leave it so
that way I'm not having to get out of my seat every time I have to
record something which is caused for like distraction both the time

You know sometimes I forget how much I fucking love running. Like
today I kind of stalled it until the last minute but the minute I
start running I'm like oh my God I needed this. It's so much like
pent-up energy and anxiety and I just feel so fucking good so like
run it out.

So a couple things. Won the system might set up for logging practice
isn't working because it's still way too rigid. I have a new idea
that I kind of like a lot better which is a start with the practice
log and work almost backwards because the idea is I want to be able
to have metrics and graphs and stuff like that. You know to almost
break down these charts into like monthly dashboards and quarterly
dashboards where certain things are like measured and demonstrated so
like for example at the most granular level to practice, log should
have an ability to just name the exercise and tag like the related
exercise and put in like a metric for it so that for instance,
something like you know, improving ride, swing speed I can put in
what was actually measured today like what I actually practiced at
today that way in like an overarching thing like a weekly dashboard
or monthly or quarterly I can create some kind of chart that
visualizes the progress over that time. You know this stuff is really
just for added motivation too. It's not like super important but I do
need some kind of practice log cause everything feels like really
almost unintentional and undisciplined without it and using this
method I think we can create the like the plan to work backwards from
a goal instead of starting with the goal and you know, kind of
working backwards from that. So that we basically have like the daily
view, and then like the quarterly view, and then things like the
monthly in the weekly should just be like kind of projected targets.
The thing that I really need to figure out how to solve is for more I
guess harder to measure things like this method works well for you
know metric based measurements and whatever but it really doesn't
work well for anything else like learning songs and stuff like that
like I feel like the problem I'm having right now it's that it's
taking super long to learn songs from like a really granular level
because there's no criterion for passing off on it and I don't know
it feels a bit ambiguous like I think what it needs is just for me to
write down like a strategic system for it. I don't know. It's hard
right now. I need to think about it more.

It's almost like I'm sitting at this crossroads or intersection at
something where I realize to get better at something like jazz or
really any genre it's just gonna require me. You know playing it and
learning new music in it and really just copying people for a while
and getting the vocabulary down and I think the good thing is like as
I do it, I gain more and more insights into the process like you know
certain movements become easier and like mortgages added to my
vocabulary so I get to play around a bit more shit like that and just
experiment but I think the mental barrier or hurdle I have is like
working on the technical side of things because there's no really
methodical way of breaking down the music

I want you to create a comprehensive rundown of all that we've
discussed so far, but with the following:

- The tiers beyond black belt should be the inflection point between
  taking part in opportunities and being the person to create
opportunities, with the black belt itself being the first
introduction to creating opportunities (eg teaching)
- The scale from white belt to black belt should be relatively linear
  in difficulty escalation, while the Dan's should be exponential.
Both should build off of everything learned earlier
- Curriculum should teach humility, generosity, gratitude, good
  listening, respect, discipline, leadership, teamwork, creating
value, and perseverance alongside all the technical mastery
- Each tier will have a technique, musicality, dynamic, time, sound,
  and groove requirement as defined by Benny Greb's Effective
Practice for Musicians. The requirement should be the simplest and
most minimal requirement that demonstrates mastery over that tier's
level and category. The requirement should also be specific,
measurable, attainable, and relevant and build off of the previous
level. 
- Use at least 15 highly reputable sources in building this list

The wager

Everything I want now lies behind something I'm terrified of, and
I've run out of excuses. Have to exercise discipline and do them
anyways
- Jazz jam
- New friends
- Asking fgirls out
- Starting business The more I do this, the easier it gets

# 12-10-2025

Intentions:
- home and eat 1330
- Meditate 1400
- Walk Mu 1440
- Exercise 1530
- Structure routines 1630
- Practice Monk's Dream

What's causing me the most pain?
- Keeping my systems stuck in my head. Not creating rules or systems
  to guide practice more effectively and relying exclusively on
memory and finite energy sources to get me there
- Ineffective practice time
- Not incorporating the knowledge I've gained over practice
- Not sitting with problems long enough to have solutions 


I feel like right now I'm trying to look at how effective my days are
and I'm trying to be more specific on what I focus on and completing
things I focus on because I feel like the problems that I've had for
so long have come from that ADHD mindset that I grew up with where
it's not about completing it's about starting and you know I look
back on pretty much all my life with the challenge was that there was
never an end. There was never a deadline, and because of that there
was no achievement that you know there was nothing to grow towards,
but I'm laying in bed right now and one of the things I get most
frustrated about is that it seems like every day there's like at
least a two hour period after work where I don't do anything and I
feel like in the moment the emotion makes sense and I feel like I
excuse it but then every day it seems to harm me like I can't tell if
it's a matter of actually needing a break or if it's more about being
stuck in this like habit loop

It's like is it bad that in the middle of the day I prioritize sleep
or is that self-care? Like I think what I'm struggling with is I
don't understand the divide between what is genuine self-care and
what is taking care of my needs and what is being undisciplined? Or
unfocused?

Do less but put more thought into what you'll do

Watching videos during practice is a bad habit. It reinforces
distracted listening, which inevitably makes its way to playing with
others. Have to train the ability to listen intently for long periods
as much as playing for long periods. Like a meditation

Less is more. Seek to accomplish less, but give what you want to
accomplish full structure and attention. Relish discomfort

Tool for transcribing: auto loop bars/phrases. Tool should be able to
hear these

There's a lot stewing in my mind right now that I don't quite
understand. Becoming a completionist, what that means and the
diligence required to fulfill it. I think I find myself unreliable
and I'm worried that I will forget about this initiative and go back
to who I was. That if I'm not creating systematic ways which I'll
follow through with difficult and terrifying things, that I'll
eventually give up or during a hard day I'll succumb to resistance.
All the while, I feel like I'm also having to overcome the trauma of
my childhood, having been forced so many times into roles I didn't
belong. I worry that discipline is at odds with comfort. Or maybe
more so peace, but it also is telling that I chose to use the word
comfort in the first place. I haven't yet understood how to find
peace and love in discomfort I think.

What can I do to ensure and trust I'll complete things?
- SMART goals

It's also a matter of distancing myself from how I was raised.
Forced, but not disciplined.

Easy way to set up drum recording: camera setup using cameras I
already have connected to the output of the mixer

Starting to see it at Starbucks. Goal is to create a systematic, yet
definitive, "assembly line" system that has an expected learning
time. Would be good to test out different methods for learning songs,
see which ones are the best or most efficient

# 12-12-2025

What if the selling point is that you could go to any school, but we
are the one for the best drumming? Like we can get them in top
schools, top program, all state, etc. I wonder if there's a market
for that. Like...a parent looking to get their kid into drumming.
They could go to guitar center or music and arts or the school that's
entirely focused on creating and pumping out legendary drummers.

# 12-13-2025

Sitting in the car with Annie, Dave, and parents, I finally
understand the boon of meditation in these settings. Entering into
that purely observational state is like being able to retreat into a
different room. When you don't react to people or anything and just
observe, it's like this secret weapon of constant calm you can
retreat to. Like getting back into a shell. It's so bwautiful

Self reliant in social settings is a goal. There's this new dream of
being so unattached that I can be myself everywhere I go. Being
friends with everyone means being attached to no one. Like show up at
a place, talk to everyone. It's like, I used to think that connecting
with everyone indicated a lack of depth. Now I see it as freedom and
opportunity
