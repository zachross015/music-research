# November

The month of November was another of suffering. Coming out of the pains in October, I still felt the effects of burnout. Each of the first two weeks weighed heavily on me as I neglected the structures that had carried me thus far. At the center of all of it was the questions "Who's it for" and "What's it for?" I maintained my habits, hoping that they would all be carried onto the next version of me. I took two breaks this month: one for the burnout and one for Thanksgiving. The second ended up being much more fruitful than the first, as the first one was spent at home still simmering in the pains I'd been stewing with.

It's become clear to me in this time how fragile the life I built currently stands, and amidst the destruction another toppling has brought, I feel hope for the future. I have nothing where I am, but I can start over once again and build a brighter future. This time, building the structure first in a way that not only allows me to continue with my art, but in a way that houses others as well as myself. I've begun realizing in the changes I've faced that I can't do this alone. I've begun realizing the impacts others play not only on my growth but also on the fortitude of my structure. Most importantly, I've begun seeing clearly how much I've neglected those around me. I seek to build something bigger and better this time. I've also begun realizing that wanting to achieve something for the sake of achievement is enough, and the best gift I can give with that is inspiring others to do the same. Running a marathon is a great achievement. So is making $1,000,000. Neither of them are bad things, and doing them for the sake of doing them is a good enough reason as any. The person we come on the way to doing those things and the structures we build is what it's all about. The key at this point is realizing what's necessary, doing it with full intention, cut out all that's unnecessary, and see to completion.

## Achievements

1. Adopted a more generous approach to business
2. Recovered from burnout/took breaks when I needed them
3. Improved ride swing speed by 10 BPM
4. Settled into my current structure and removed the stress 

## Friction

- No overarching structure or plan moving forward.
- Focus is frequently spread between different areas
- Breaks are dismissed from any plans, or plans are made without intention for breaks. This is done at a macro as well as micro scale
- Habits around thinking about others are scarce
- Planning is done without intention to complete and without any preparedness for reality. Eg making big plans for the week without considering Starbucks (bleh) then making excuses not to follow through.
- Habits around giving primarily financially motivated
- Sitting on the edge of the present (always moving on to what's next)
- Lack of focus
- Lack of follow through
- Moving against the season instead of with it
  - Diet is an unfortunate consequence of this
- Doing too much in the wrong season. People aren't going to many shows in the winter. BUT. Everyone is looking for deals for lessons.
- Didn't attend a jazz jam (didn't figure out the dates or even make a plan to go)
- Spending time video gaming instead of habits / structure (part of not scheduling time for breaks or a greater habit of playing first)
    - Part of this also stems from allowing tasks to take up much more time than they need. Eg, this review has been like two hours in the making and if I'd just focused in and finished it I'd have more time for Yakuza.
- Not spending enough time coming up with solutions to the problem I face each period
- Avoiding working with others or being a part of something bigger
- Avoiding including others
- Expediency of task completion (linked to focus and priority)
- Prioritizing one off tasks (eg doctors appointment, vet, tire repairs, etc)
- Allowing the difficult and terrifying tasks to keep me stuck
- Not spending enough time coming up with solutions
- Not learning enough from incompletion 
- Insecurity around drumming again. Not sure if it's a not enough evidence thing, lifestyle problems, or something else. Its hard to feel like I'm improving right now there.

## The ONE Thing

I think it all boils down to two things actually.
1. The way that I plan my periods and tasks is uneducated and unstructured. I think it worked when I was starting, but now I need something that motivates me to completion (or that I feel compelled to complete either way), takes into account obstacles I might face, fault tolerance (ie breaks), and plays a part in the overlying structure. The system needs to go as follows:
   1. Create a plan with obstacles in mind
   2. See it through to completion. No matter what.
   3. Learn from what went wrong. Spend enough time with the problem to come up with a solution that doesn't entirely rely on an unreliable structure (eg memory).
2. Not enough attention or execution in my day to day is given to other people. It is almost entirely focused on my own anxieties and fears, rather than the gifts I could be giving others. This has to change if I'm going to find the people I'm looking for.

## Goals for next month

1. Plan and structure goals for next year
2. Book all appointments
