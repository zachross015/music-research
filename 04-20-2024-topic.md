# A Brief History on Jazz Drumming

The first American form of music, creolized from the Afro-Cuban rhythms that
were brought up to New Orleans from Cuba and the swing style of ragtime. It was
an instrumental genre until someone started singing to it.

The history of jazz drumming is obscure. Somewhere between New Orleans and New
York...I have no idea what I'm talking about.

Jazz can be split into several different eras.

1. Pre-Jazz (ragtime) 2. Swing 3. Big Band (1930's-1940's) 4. Bebop (Late
1940's) 5. Hard bop (1960's)

The drummers of these eras are Louis Bellson, Gene Krupa, Buddy Rich, Art
Blakey, Elvin Jones, Max Roach, Jo Jones, Papa Jones, and I'm sure there are
others.

The big change from big band to bebop era was marked by a growth in
intelligence. Starting out at Minton's club with Charlie Parker, Dizzy
Gillepsie (is that true?), Chick Corea (i don't think they were involved),
Thelonius Monk, and Sonny Rollins (I don't think they were involved either).
Big band's touted extravagence but they were a luxury not many could afford.

The distinctive style of bebop required a much denser knowledge of music
theory. At Minton's club, the jam sessions were often dangerous by nature.
Everything was up tempo, and the players would try and confuse each other in an
effort to see if each person could adapt. Drummers played with time,
keyboardists would change keys spontaneously. Charlie Parker even was kicked
out at the beginning of these sessions for inadequate knowledge of theory.

In the ragtime era, the bass part was covered by the tuba (I think), but due to
the difficulty and lack of dexterity, the kick drum alternated with the tuba
parts to create the pulse of the song. This is why the drum style of ragtime
alternated the kick drum and the hihat. When double-bass subbed in for the
tuba, endurance and dexterity was no longer an issue and the bass was used
instead to improve the attack of the double bass (there's probably a better
reason). Leading into the Bebop era, drummers stopped would periodically "drop
bombs," putting more force behind the bass drum.

## Questions

1. What is the actual story here? How do you tell an engaging story about the
history of a subject?  

The story is how the style and techniques of drumming evolved throughout the
different periods of music history, specificiall jazz history. Its about how
the different drummers influenced one another and the cultural influences that
shaped the performances during each era. 

2. What are the actual eras? What are the time periods of each era? What is
distinct about each era?  


3. Where do the drummers of each era belong?  
4. How did each of the drummers influence each other?  
5. Why was there a shift from Big Band to bebop? What was happening during that
time in history that necessitated smaller ensembles?  
6. Why did the kick drum double up with the double-bass? And why did it
alternate with the tuba?  
7. Who was the first to start dropping bombs?

8. How did the drum style evolve throughout the eras? What part did each limb
and instrument play?

Good information to start.

A further question from this resource, did big band jazz evolve as a mixture of the classical music of the whites combined with the blues/ragtime music of the african americans?
