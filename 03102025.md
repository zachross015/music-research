Starting off watching [Buddy Rich Big Band Live At The North Sea Jazz Festival
• 15-07-1978 • World of Jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUDM1hwtRQ). To
be honest, I have no idea what I'm looking for. I'm enjoying this, and 
watching the video is a better experience than just listening. 

I guess I'm trying to understand different swing patterns? The way bass is used?
Comping? Now that I've gotten used to it, trad grip is so fucking nice. The solo
ending at 13:32 is amazing. How did Buddy Rich build it? I think learning all of
his parts on Best Coast would be super insightful. Does he have an earlier
video?

How does the ride pattern make me feel?

Theres alot of energy to it. Almost like its bleeding into the next beat. It's
pronounced but not overbearing. 

Comparing this to Gene Krupa's pattern in [Gene
Krupa "Sing, Sing, Sing" on The Ed Sullivan Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyAUKU_ImNg)
whose pattern has more of the typical decrescendo, accenting 2 and 4. He really
doesn't use Hihat at all, except for when he's playing low tom. 

Gene is such a showman. He looks like he's having fun while playing, like
a genuine performer. Alot of jazz drummers seem like this, using the drums and
cymbals in unconventional ways and creating new sounds with them.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here. My goal is to just watch some
performances every day and pick up on more of the essence of jazz. Part of it
feels like a waste of time, but I think that's just resistance. I already feel
like I'm learning something, but I don't understand what it is. Maybe it doesn't
have to be that structured. Maybe I can just enjoy this.

Need to continue watching [The story of Gene Krupa Part
1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OwuWpwIRQ8) tomorrow.
