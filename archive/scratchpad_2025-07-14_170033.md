I think the more I develop as a drummer, the more I want to cater to beginners. For multiple reasons: 
- I feel like they will benefit from me the most, as I'm trying to take people in without outlets and give them an outlet
- It aligns me with Sebastian Lague and Bob Ross as someone that takes complicated practices and gives beginners hope that they could reach that potential
  - REALLY important not to abuse or take for granted the difficulty it takes to get where I am 
- It makes me feel good to work with beginners. I can help advanced people eventually but I want high quality beginners looking for an outlet

What are the overarching goals we are trying to accomplish with Elena? I guess get her singer songwriter ready, but as with anything I want to express this a s a creative outlet. I feel like an emphasis on feeling is much more important here. But she’s also looking to get into Brazillian stuff so which direction wshould we work towards first brazillian shit or creativity I guess that kinda depends on what most enthuses her she does seem to look around the room quite a bit but doesn’t get distracted in the same way that Amanda does maybe its a small insight she yawned alot idk what to go over next i think theres so much to learn here but I don’t really know where to start i guess I need to identify what are the abc’s of drumming what are the letters that can form essays in the end what are teh roles of the drummer the time keeper the energy the bandleader the loud and deadly one I guess it’s worth asking if she wants to play live it would be sick if we could get her a live show down the line but I'm thinking what else could work here what else would make the lesson better because I think the confidence I need to succeed is in creating a good structure for her she's more ambiguous and will go in whatever direction I take her which is different from Amanda who kind of leads the way so its an area I think I need to be a better leader in and have a higher sense of direction she can do the basic drum beat and basic fill so what comes next maybe we need to be splitting it all into two places? Idk its weird I guess maybe it would be good to break it down into the 6 categories of time groove musicality sound technique and dynamics but also what is most important right now like if we only have 4 weeks to learn how do we get the most out of those 4 weeks and what is most important to the beginner drummer what's going to motivate her the most these are questions I really don't have the answers too like I'm guiding her but I feel like I don't fully resonate with towards what so maybe think back when I was in middle schoool what motivated me the most was being able to play with my favorite songs like I remember coming home and charting out buddy holly playing along with that song I remember sitting at the kit and playing the same thing every day but how do I encourage someone without a drum set to play at home to practice along with their music how do I encourage her to continue improving outside of the lessons we have together I'm not sure at all I'm not sure of anything I guess what do I think we can get to after 4 weeks lets start there including this last lesson where do I envision her being we can always adjust guess I imagine her being able to read music from a basic level or is that already too far how long does it even take to read music maybe we start with that but Idk I think that doesnt really matter okay then I imagine her being able to listen a song and pick up an essential groove from it to hear that song being played and be able to play along with the essential parts of it so for that we need the groove essentials the basic beats which compose the genre especially indie and punk music the essentials of what composes those musics those are mostly single performance kind of genres I think but it might be good to kinda compile the essential grooves of those genres so I guess the best way to progress here is to go over a couple things within the next month
- form of songs, how to break it down and diagnose it (should have email notes they can refer back to, or construct a way they can take notes?)
- the essential grooves of the genre, learning each one of them so they can apply them
- essential rudiments of the genre or even in general
- essential fills of the genre
and what will help me build the habits right off the bat is to reccomend a pad and sticks combination, or even give them to them? I REALLY like the idea of gifting it to them as part of the welcome package to motivate them further, that and maybe some sheet music paper I think that kidn of thing will help me to motivate them especially teaching them how to practice this stuff without a kit since it's not guaranteed they will have a drum kit to play with so yeah.
one thing that I think will help out in the long run too is to identify the passive growth opportunities vs the active ones, eg like technique building.

From here, I feel like the best way to further progress is to develop these into SMART goals that her and I can visualize progress on, build an email review that lists progress towards goals. God, the visualization in my head is so fucking cool that I want to include.
- Easy interface for me to create a goal and list quantifiable progress (eg learn 4 songs, update to 1 song after the lesson and show them progress bars that work towards an achievement).  
- Text review for summarizing other things that happened during lesson
- Homework area 
- "Send" or "Save" button that compiles all progress and sends an email which condenses all the progress into a simple view for them. 
  - Feedback button at the bottom
- Eventually also want an interface for them to see these progress markers and overarching goal
- module creation
- Eventually sell the app to other private lessons companies
- Badge creator within app
- Ideally ipad app
- Lesson creator and student manager in app

I can get everything done much faster if I stop going back from the beginning and relistening/rewatching and instead just trust whatever I'm doing to have the desired effect. This distracts and takes out of flow. It's a good break but it doesnt accomplish much when I'm in the weeds. #insights

Definitely getting quicker at doing this transcription, especially for comping. I think just sitting down and praciticing it is really helping, plus internalizing the feeling. #progress

A new good idea for a path is to go on a van trip, recording something new at many different destinations, vlogging the whole thing. Become known as this legendary drummer that just shows up at random jazz jams to spread music and a love for it. #ideas #path
