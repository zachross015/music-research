I feel like a really cool business plan should and growth should revolve around some initial habits:
- Daily posting on tiktok (in a way that I could be proud of)
- Weekly blog/newsletter (collected as a summary from journals, what resistance is there)
Need to get over resistance to more long term solutions, such as redundant catchphrases or content consistency. 

Timeline:
- Phase 1: Start independent business and learn to trust yourself to fly.
    - Get 15 students at $50/hour. Do whatever it takes. Post fliers first. Talk with people. Cold call. Cold email. Book lunches with producers, players, etc. Jam sessions. Let everyone know you're taking students. Be selfish. Become comfortable with onboarding. Write down what works.
    - Weekly gig schedule.
    - Form an LLC.
- Phase 2: Grow online presence. Intention is to attract higher quality students, people willing to pay more, but also expand out of the local network and make work sustainable anywhere.
  - Habitualize TikTok (daily post for 66 days straight).
  - Habitualize Newsletter (weekly post for 10 weeks straight).
  - Habitualize Blog (weekly post for 10 weeks straight).
  - Quarterly YT update
- Phase 3: Move and start over.
  - Do phase 1 but somewhere else starting at $75/hr instead, with an option for online.
  - Find Monetizable product strategy
- Phase 4: Expand.
  - Start group classes. 
  - Hire another teacher.


  Good question. A content plan can easily become overwhelming if you try to make it too detailed or rigid. To minimize the amount of time it takes, you can strip it down to the essentials that actually move the needle and automate/reuse as much as possible. Here are some ways:

### 1. Start With a **Simple Framework**

* **Pillars:** Pick 3‚Äì4 broad themes you‚Äôll post about (e.g. *drumming technique, performance stories, student success, mindset*).
* **Formats:** Decide 2‚Äì3 types of content you‚Äôll make (e.g. short-form video, newsletter, blog).
* **Frequency:** Pick a cadence you can *actually* keep up with (e.g. 2 reels + 1 newsletter per week).

This prevents decision fatigue and keeps the scope small.

### 2. Use a **Content Matrix**

Take each pillar and pair it with each format. That gives you a plug-and-play set of ideas. For example:

* **Technique √ó Reel** = Quick tip demonstration
* **Mindset √ó Newsletter** = Reflection about practice discipline
* **Performance Story √ó Blog** = Recap of a gig

You don‚Äôt have to brainstorm from scratch every week.

### 3. Batch the Work

* **Brainstorm once a month** ‚Üí list 8‚Äì12 ideas in one sitting.
* **Create once a week** ‚Üí film/write a small batch in 1‚Äì2 hours.
* **Schedule once** ‚Üí queue them in a scheduling tool.

This turns ‚Äúdaily decisions‚Äù into a single block of time.

### 4. Repurpose Aggressively

One piece = multiple uses:

* A **video tip** ‚Üí captioned reel ‚Üí transcript ‚Üí newsletter blurb ‚Üí tweet.
* A **long-form blog** ‚Üí chopped into 3 posts + email.
  You‚Äôre multiplying output without multiplying effort.

### 5. Lower the Bar for Quality

* Aim for **consistent, good-enough** content, not polished masterpieces.
* Use **templates** for graphics, captions, and hooks.
* Reuse intros/outros instead of reinventing them every time.

The less you start from scratch, the faster it goes.

### 6. Track What Works

Every 4‚Äì6 weeks, check: *What got engagement, questions, sign-ups, or leads?*
Drop what flops ‚Üí double down on what works.
That way, you stop wasting time producing filler.

üëâ The ‚Äúminimal viable content plan‚Äù is just:

* **3‚Äì4 pillars**
* **2‚Äì3 formats**
* **1‚Äì2 posts per week**
* **Repurpose + batch**

Everything else is optional polish.

Do you want me to help you design a **time-minimized template** for your drum coaching brand, where you can just slot ideas in instead of rebuilding a plan every time?
