The most confusing part of afro cuban #drumming has been that its a replication of multiple instruments, not just the instrument on its own. Its the only real form of drumming where drum set didn't start out as the main instrument. Going into learning it, I had the impression that I was picking up a guide on drumset performance, but what I've learned from this book is that none of AFro-Cuban music was ever written or intended for drum set. The different timing feels conflict with 4/4 all the time, because they weren't written in 4/4. They were alwasy meant to groove as a standalone. I think it was just frustrating going into the topic thinking i was learning how to play like bossa nova and salsa and instead got an introduction to how drums aren't welcomed here from the beginning. I'm still struggling to understand all the cultural significances and all the other parts being played on top of the clave.
