So I need to do a dump right now. Tryingt o organize my days again and it's once again coming to this point where I feel like I'm doing way too many things at once. balancing way too much like if i look at all thats accomplishable in a day i almost feel this like disdain for what needs to be done the discipline thats required of me to do things that see no results to go through each day with like nothing to show for with no results and to constantly be stuck at this point of indecision on what to prioritize like its driving me fucking carazy the indecision because theres pros and cons for every side and i just wish i had someone else taking the reigns here i wish i had someone else to guide me because idk i feel like i come to a conclusion about something like, for instance, exercise where my priorities are supposed to be sleep then food then exercise and meditation then practice but when i structure life like that nothing moves nothing goes anywhere i stay exactly where i am and thats the point im frustrated about is that im entering a period where i want to be more effective with that time because im afraid of how slowly im moving im afraid taht even when im beginning to grow faster im still so slow and that what im doing now has nothing to show for like im sat at a crossroads right now where ihave an hour left of dilligent time an hour before i need to chill out and reward myself but i spent three hours fucking around after work watching tv eating sleeping masturbating and its just this part of my routine which absolutely drains my time like imagine if i had three more hours today imagine what i couldve gotten done and is that the ADHD talking or is that truth its like a priority thing but its also like anger and frustration and energy likfe i keep telling myself that i didn't have energy in the moment to do anything about it but that pisses me off because they dont have energy in war they dont have energy in the office they survive on a constant fight or flight even a monk will practice disciplined for days at a time i feel like im living life backwards and like im constantly still a slave to my circumstances like today i cowarded out of the jamm session for jazz and its like i see the wall i see the barrier the terror that comes from trying to do things the reason im alwas stuck right here but i dont know what to do about any of it i dont know how to prioritize those things more effectively especially when all i want is accomplishment because i think about what the greats say about losing sleep about giving it your all constant playing obsession and obsession and obsession and i worry that im not good enough to be that person that im faulting myself for even tryibng and that im trying to be amazing at way too many things at once like trying to run a marathon it just feels instead like im constantly failing msyelf over and over and over and over again like my idea of recreation is skewed towards mindlessness and that my need for mindlessness and dopamine is causing me so much pain like i feel like over the past tow years ive genuinely learned that after a certain point there is a wall that gets hit where if i try to force myself to do anything after that point it ruins the next day and the next day but i feel like there are people more disciplined than me doing more than me but arent complaining about it theyre just doing ti like if i didn't have to nap in the middle of the day after fucking starbucks then i could practice more or if i didn't have to stop two hours before bed i could practice more like thats 5 more hours in the day that i could be exercising or practicing or working on business thats just spent fucking mucking around doing nothing draining my soul of anything and i feel liketheres this narrative in my mind that i need to take thos ebbreaks but i dont really know if thats true they feel like bad habits but even this talking about it complaining about it....I COULD BE FUCKING DOING SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. and im not im just sitting around fucking complaining that i have no time to do anything 

and it feels like the part of it thats the most fucking frustrating is that the learning process is way too fucking difficult to systemitize and
