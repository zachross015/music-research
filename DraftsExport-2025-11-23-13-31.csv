- Kick mic holder
- aux to quarter
- Interface
- Quarter inch
- Room treatment
- Camera light

The ideal I'm working towards is having a long term storage solution for practice recording. A way to sit down, hit record, and be able to go back and analyze recordings. Optionally be able to also pipe the output to a video feed for video content. Goal is to also do this with minimal setup, getting rid of all the big black lighting and camera holders

- Mics into mixer for practice (would help improving audio for things like reels, especially if we can record)

I think I keep focusing on the pain rather than the way forward, putting so much pressure on how was the past was better. It feels like the path forward now is to stop putting so much into what life used to look like and instead what it could look like. 

I think trying to decide between gigging and lessons and original work is not what I should be doing. Instead, I feel like should be focusing on the one thing that's preventing me from doing all three. The leadership aspect. The working with other people aspect. Building a company that can include all the ways I want to grow:
- Leading my own group
- Writing music with anyone/frequent collab
- Teaching
- Auditioning 
- Networking
- Playing live frequently
- Teaching clinics
- Building teaching and learning tools
- Session work
- building a drum studio
- Owning and possibly renting out all the live sound equipment 
- Learning how to properly market and advertise all these things
And focusing on building one aspect at a time. All under this umbrella of giving the gift of music to more people.

And the way I can get back to spirituality is recognize that God is the one already giving me these ideas. To stop taking ownership of them and feel grateful that the universe has guided me this way.

Like the idea is to build it from the beginning in this way, to include all the things I love about music. But I feel like I should be doing it instead from a way of how is each thing helping the people I serve.

I'm gonna choose the wrong thing make a mistake. I think it's less than that like I'm worried about picking a path where I don't still get to pursue the things, I love about music the whole thing with content creation I think feels safe and comfortable because I'm not even really having to interact with people like I've been doing it for a long enough that I think I know what I'm trying to do and so like it feels like the creative route where I actually get to make things and that would be true if I actually made things I think lessons in live performances sounds so daunting because it's actually having to include other people and test my own reliability and my ability to move as quick as I need to, but you know contact creation hasn't done anything like I haven't made anything from it like I feel like what I want to do is I wanna pick one thing to commit to right now so that I can have more time again because right now it feels like trying to decide between doing content and doing live stuff just just indecisiveness is draining the hell out of me and I think it's cause like the things that keep getting stuck in my mind or that I have to commit to one forever, which just isn't true it's giving me like the squeezy feeling in my gut because I'm just really not sure what to do and I feel like I just need to commit, but I don't want to commit to the wrong one and I feel like the fact that I keep thinking about this is making it harder to commit to something because I just keep saying stuck in the state of fucking misery. Just trying to figure out what to do with my life and it's like I look at the people that I'm inspired by and they have it all already they could do any of these things you know they don't have to worry about the drumming part they get to worry about it

I feel like I'm being torn, limb from limb right now it's like every time I have to venture out and begin, including other people. It feels like this unattainable dream. Like there's this massive wall of pain that prevents me from being you know the one in charge of the leader or even just someone that makes things happen and I feel like I'm looking at you know life and structure and seeing that like, I need more fault tolerance in the in the life I have in room for you know serendipity, or growth and I can't figure out what to cut out and I can't really decide because it's like I wanna run a marathon so running is a big one and I need mindfulness so meditating is a big one and the benefits of meditation change everything and so like right now it comes down basically to drum practice or business development and it doesn't feel like I have time for either of them yet those are the things that are the long-term priorities and I think just the idea of being on the hook or on the line is terrifying. Like I understand the things I have to do now and like the kind of structure I need to build for myself to succeed. It's like even just one gig a week could possibly cover all the expenses. I have right now the concept of that is crazy, but attainable or even like five students could do the same thing, but what's stopping me is like having to work with other people having to lead other people you know having to be in charge of other people and I think it's like the same thing at Starbucks right now. I don't know why I feel so impossible.

And I think it's because hearing myself talk about things like music and my love for it and getting to play with people and all that kind of stuff something about it feels reassuring like even when I'm in a state of apathy or depression debt there is still some part of me choosing to do the things I love to do and that there's still some part of me feeling that level of gratitude. It's like when they talk about how you're falling to the level of your habits, it's really heartwarming, knowing that the habits I have now continue to reflect the person I want to be in moments where I don't feel like that person. Like in the video, I talk a lot about service to other people which is still something that I'm struggling to comprehend in a major way, but hearing myself talk about it from that perspective gives me hope that even when I don't feel great I'm still working towards that.
