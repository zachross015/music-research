## Summary

I started the review halfway through the week, so it was a bit of a half week. Need to get in the habit of summarizing here though, because I want to have it be more of a folding process between days, weeks, months, years, etc.

- Began reading This Is Marketing
- Discovered new avenues for Shadow Work
	- Why I resist coaching friends or why I enjoy working with strangers
	- Anxiety in making plans with friends
		- Actual anxiety being more along the lines of the trauma I've had for being excited about something and dissapointed when people bail, or even moreso on un-reciprocated excitement, ways my excitement was punished
	- Looking for problems in attchments
- Made my first (genuine) educational TikTok
- Noticed how possessive I feel of Brandi
	- Progress in seeing that I no longer see her as having dishonest intentions. She's genuine, even when they aren't. Still have a hard time re-centering
- Made conversation with a stranger
- Realized I don't actually enjoy camping, I have trauma around it
- Noticed connection between body stiffness and anxiety
- Idea for blog: Simple Landscape of Jazz
- Realized full immersion in genres is what makes for great musicians, in the way an Actor playing a Seal might actually go through Seal training
- Mom stated she thought it was cool watching this all grow
- Began having gratitude for the seeds I planted a year ago, seeing how they all connect to what's happening now
- Shifted the narrative from wanting to be owned to wanting to own her
- Hit a wall with practice, lack of understanding in the dynamics of jazz versus AFro Cuban
- Struggled with smart phone addiction, dopamine addiction
- Noticed that my attachment to Brandi is a consistent issue. It's always an issue I have with her. There's a massive gravitation of my attention towards her when she's around, constantly monitoring her for signs that she might abandon me. It's a sexual dynamic. It's just creating drama. And it's draining all my energy.
- Noticed the importance of intention in more places. Walking slowly but intentionally, talking slowly but intentionally while remaining connected, both are ways to bring more presence into my life.
- Started being more openly loving with my friends: more eye contact, freer expressions of love, deeper intimacy in interactions, more vulnerable, liberal with compliments, etc.
- Realized problem with early reels is I had not target audience. I just wanted to show off. Identifying a REAL audience of my friends has helped to ground the marketing dynamic. Looking to this for the future is super important.

## Good Things

- Much greater gratitude, confidence, and sense of direction with all of my marketing funnels
- External acknowledgement of my growth was abundant
- Greater confidence and abundance of love in my life, even from non-relationship sources
- Created my first genuine tiktok
- Progress in recognizing my attachment issues

---

## Primary Issues

- Dopamine was a problem. Pretty much everyday was spent as a mindless slave, unable to stick to habits or feel love and constantly feeling deprived of energy.
- Still didn't practice any dilligence in how to improve Amanda's practice (although it wasn't much of a goal)
- Obsession with Brandi has been an energy drain for far too long
- Absolutely god awful financial and food habits have also caused energy drain

## Goals

o Do Shadow work on the tension-release attachment pattern
o Get through Guaguanco chapter
o Brainstorm ways to increase Amanda's lesson value
