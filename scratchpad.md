Need to start trying to understand the difference between stable dullness and other dullnesses. I think I can recognize dullness when it starts to appear now, but am having a hard time fighting it (maybe from fatigue) and definitely don't know how to stabilize it. I think another good thing would plan out what I want everyday to look like going forward.
