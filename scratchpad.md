Continuing from my journal. I think the part that got activated when talking to mimza was the superiority complex. I saw in her everything I was, and I guess everything I still am. Especially though the parts I was ashamed of, buecause she's still in this period of her artistic development where everything that matters is viewer counts and enagemetns and what ever the fuck else. TAlking to my mom was the same except she came from a place of concern and I felt like I had to defence mysefl. I fell like I had something genuine to talk about here bu I think it's getting lost somewhere. It's been stuck in my head.

Like I started this route because it's what I wanted to do. And I loved it. But I also did it because I thought everyone everywhere else was miserable. But going to the run club...idk. I don't see he full stories, but I connect with pepole there. I used to think music was the only place I could connect, but here I am at multiple different groups engaging with different people. And I think it creates theis major discrepansy in my head because I thought that all these people were miserable. That by following my dreams i would be happy. That I was evading the discourse of capitalism by doing things a different way. But all I've learned so far (not all i learned byt something) is that this way is so much fucking harder. Like these grad school students...i remember what it was like to be them. And if I had had them aroundt during my studies, I don't think I wouldn' dropped out. It makes me regret the past. I mean, like idk. It's easy to look back and wished Id done things differently, but I do feel a slight envy. I try to have the grace of i did the best with what I knew at the time, which is the truth. 

I'm really having a hard time articulating this thought. It's like...I feel stuck. I feel like I've made such huge changes at the start of the year and I'm at a point where things are kind of settling and what used to feel like proress anow feels like limitation. Like I'm not masturbating, yet I'm still having the problems I had when I began masturbating. Maybe it's just the numbness, idk. And like now that I've been off social media for a while, I'm tempted to get back on just for new connections, new people. But I know it's just this fucking trap.

I still can't really articulate it. 

I thought that by doing music, I'd be happier. Things would be easier. Like even if shit got difficult, I had the pursuit of a dream to pull me through. But 2.5 years in and I'm still living at home on Valentines Day alone. And the superiority of chasing my dreams falls short when I realize other people are growing too and that chasing dreams is not what made them happy. 

Still not it.

I thought it would happen sooner, easier, adn with less ambiguity. I believed I was special for being brave enough to try and tenacious enough to perservere. I thought I was special. I bet on that. I bet on the idea that what I would see in the future was a vision from God meant to be fulfilled by me and me alone. I believed that there was someone perfect out there for me, someone who fit every nook and cranny and complemented me in the best ways. I believed that good looks were part of the package and effortlessness came alongside. I believed that if you just showed up and gave it your all and tried to look the best doing it, that you'd be rewarded. That it would get easier and easier until you didn't think aobut it. I believed I was destined for something, that I was going to change the world as a drummer, and the whole world would open up and welcome me. That I was a messiah, a God. And that everyone wanted a part of that. That they wanted to be included somewhere in the story. That I could walk in the room and people would immediately be attracted to and turned on by my aura. That if I worked on myself enough, I wouldn't have to do any of the work of attracting in the right people and opportunities.

But today, I feel hopeless. I feel abandoned. I feel like where I was believed in something, I now feel empty. It feels like there's an imbalance between the value I provide the world and what I want back for it, and that difference is driving me insane. Beause I've been conditioned into insecutiry, first by my parents and then people at my school. In joining all these new social gruops I feel so drained tringt to perform genuinness. I come from having to hide so much and shapeshift into every group to be the center of attention so much that I've lost all sense of self, and now that life is demanding me to be strong, know myself, and have grace in conversation i feel like a failure. I can't talk to people. I hate talkinga bout what I do because it fills me with so much anxiety. I feel like i have to defend it as if i was sacrificing babies for a living. even when i belive in the beauty of music it feels like my responsibility to convince others and make them understand how my life works. it holes me up because i would rather sit allone in a basement by myself than pretend to be happy just so you stop questioning me and asking why i dont do something else. i hate you for that. it makes me miserable trying to appease you. even now i wish i was practicing in stead of resting or sleeping or trying to type it up because every second i spend grinding away is one that gets me closer to some form of security because now my life and my blood depend on being able to perform and it drains me so much.

I feel hopeless today and I want to die. And I still can't even fucking articulate it.

It feels like what's being asked of me now, now taht I'm building new friendships and trying to get good at that, is to look deeply at the thorns of my relationships and communicating with people I connect to. It's one of the most debilitating things I've ever gone through. Because it's forcing me to confront prejudices and the nature of my reality and form a new model which is deviated so far from where I am. Like I can't help but question conversation constantly  and noticing how fucking debilitating it is for me. like its a performance and at any time i could fail. When it's not that, it's opening up the woulnds of bullying that have been so fucking destrutuive that ive only felt welcome by a select few people. like when i think about having been a nerd and now pepopel knowing i was considered a nerd, like it makes sense. of the three groups of people ive been hanging out with, russ's friends are the ones ive felt the most natural around. and ya know, that bothers me. because...none of them seem aspirational or ambitious. theyre a bucnh of fucking nerds that sit around and play board games and are so fucking happy with their lives that they have such high self esteem and can act and say whatever they want. but at the jazz jams, at the run club, i feel so insecure. like no one wants me there or like i dont belong. i was never invited to eat at their table before, so why should i now? and being surrounded by those beautiful women, great runners, amazing musicians...it all just makes me feel like i have such a long way to go. and i wish i could fucking feel secure in my own skin enough to feel constent , to be the same person in any and every room i walk into. but i cant, or i wont, and the thought antagonized me. no one wants me, no one wants to be with me, no one wants me around, im a fucking musician who cant even afford to take his dog to the vet who is stuck again in his parents house who is cluttered both physically and mentall with shit he no longer needs anad im just fucking tired im fucking tired of it all im fucking tired of trying of being awake of giving it my all just to find out i was wrong all along im tired of growth im tird of growth i tired of growth im tired of ambition i ust want to give up i want to give up i want to crawl in to a hole and never come out or pack up all my hikking gear and live in the woods for the rest of my life because ill never make it as a genuine human being as a well adjusted person because theres something wrong with me theres something so fundamentally broken about me that ill never make it in life ill never be able to find a real job and become a real adult im forced to be stuck in my parents basement for the rest of my life because amy and steve fucked me up so much that i cant live i cant exist and thats all they talk about whenver they go out to eat they conspire to kick me out one day they dont care if i succeed they dont care what i feel they dont care about my dreams i see the specials my dad watches the fucking conspiracy shit he gets into those fuckin alcoholics theyre pieces of shit everyone is especially me because all i do is abuse the resoucres of those around me i dont care about helping people or being a part of something beause everyone is out ot get me everyone wants to hurt me theyre all so fucking evil theyre all so fucking evil theyre all so fucking evil theyre all so fucking evil and they wont stop until im dead they wont stop until ive hung myself by noose or belt or lashed myself into oblivigon they hate me so fucking much because Im better than them beause I can take takte take so remorselessly and yet i cant do shit because all i see inside of me is the same guy that struggle d in middle school im a glorified stunted middle schooler because I cant get laid i cant even talk to women i remember the first time freezing up and ever since them my flight or firght has kicked in and all ive done is freeze i couldnt even talk to caroline without feeling like a fucking creeper and im an idiot telling people im a musician then not even being able to talk passionately about music put on the perforomance of a fucking life time you creep i saw you stalking her staring at her ass but god if she would bend ofver for me so i dont have to make her shes my age and ripe for the fucking picking but shs isnt it she isnt the one because the ones doesnt exist its impossible and even if she did shes never going to e with me because im a glofified fucking middle schooler and i see you in there you shy little guy the way they bullied you over and over you were a nerd your were so happy they introduced it all to you and they took it all away they led you to believe you were attractive but no one  wanted you not even your parents thats why they invariably forgot about you constantly why you couldnt do anything and the only place that actually accepted you was music beause everywhere else you were just exactly what they wanted you to be you had to be the chameleon or you faced their wrath you faced their pain you faced their trauman and youve always had to fend for your fucking self even know you have to defend yousrself from the world by holding up the fucking marble statue
