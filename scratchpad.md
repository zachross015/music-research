# April 27, 2025

I don't even know where to begin today. So I've been thinking alot about
dullness in meditation and it's become more apparaent to me what dullness is.
It's this nmbing of the sense, and I think the reason I got so tripped up in my
meditations for so long was that I had confused dullness with the meditative
joy that the book talks about but now it seems obvious that I have no idea what
meditative joy is and with all the other strife in my life it's hard to find
any joy in anything I'm doing at all which is this incredibly frustrating state
to be in because I have such a desire to learn more about Afro Cuban drumming,
especially the Bembe among other beautiful drumming styles but I don't feel
like I'm getting anyhwer part of that is beause my obsidian files have become
this clusterfuck of insight and awareness spread throughout the day but nothing
in there is ever made to form any kind of logical cohesiveness and it's all
frustrating.

I've been listening to Duke Ellington and Coltrane the past day or so and I
think I'm starting to pick up on the differences of drum styles but especially
genres that emerged from JAzz. Their style seems to be much more mellow which
makes me wonder how much their style was geared towards speakeasy crowds or if
that was something that even happened during their time? I know Duke was like a
founding father of Jazz along with Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton but
that's about the extent of my knowledge like did they know it was called Jazz
or "Jass" at the time or were they so in the ground floor that they couldn't
possibly know? I also had listened to alot of the ragtime origins of Louis
Armstrong (I think?) and I think he was also a founding father? I'm not
entirely certain. Something about Cotton Club and Milton's Club both are
prominent. Like Milton's Club was this space where they would challenge each
other with Jazz via speed and modulation constantly and weird licks. I listened
to some other drummers playing and I still can't differentiate the lot of them
but all I know is I really dislike any of the avant garde work Max Roach did
with that one saxophone player except some of the solos when you get to exactly
the right spot are pretty good I feel like to reallly understand the
differences between alot of these drummers the most important thing for me tod
o is just actually learn their parts. I want to explore all this so much more
like whene idd the eras begin and end? Who were the prominent players of each
era? Prominent rummers? How did the drummers affect and inpire one another? It
all to me is so fucking confusing right now and it's like I'm excited to learn
more about all of itt but I'm also scared to learn about it all because it's
like what if I do become knowledgeable and put this insane expectation on
myself to make something of it? Like I'm already starving for time but I feel
like to become more efficient at practice and more inspired means doing this
kind of study, even if it means playing drums less. Like this is why I need to
get out of Starbucks because carving time into my schedule for both practice
and progress in physical and mental capacitices requires so much time.

It's like I feel like I need to divide my schedule further and further. I don't
even know what the ideal is. Like I guess to begin with I want 3 hours a day of
dilligent drum practice (ideally more but that's a start that's achieveable)
and then 2 hours of exercise and then 1 hour of meditation, then the riest of
the day for what ever else but what even else is there? Like is it better to do
6 hours of practice and have 3 of those be set aside for knowledge aquisition?
And where does work come into play? Is it possible to get to a point where I
have some kind of self-autonomous business suite that allows me to just grow
and essentially market my skills by just posting random shit? Like what I'm
constantly seeing right now is I'm marketing without a product which is the
worst business method in the book, there's absolutely nothing to sell which
makes it hard to motivate myself to continue putting effort towards any kind of
social media work because it's fruitless I mean I do also genuinely want to
help people and I think this is where it all wraps together like having 3 hours
for research IS a form of business management, like if I can start out with
this core package that allows me to teach and move it towards a fully
autonomous online lesson plan and then have 1 student a day each week, that
would be this like perfect balance where I get to gig if I want to but in the
meantime I could spend hours but bettering myself as a musician and bettering
my mind to teach people better and I guess I don't always have the best
intentions it's frustrating and I think the final part I want to hit on is that
I feel like I'm forcing myself to have MONTHS of research into a subject in
order to feel qualified, but if I just take it one week, one day at a time and
use this method I've come up with with ChatGPT, then it's possible that month
of research can be done in a week. It's all just bringing out high school
insecurity.

Who drummed for Duke?

Ohh wow, Louis Bellson did in the 1950's. That's quite the connection. I wonder
what tracks he played on. But before that it was Sonny Greer from 1924-1951 and
after that was some other guys. The big hit with Louis Bellson was "Skin Deep."
I feel like the more I look into the history of drummers, Louis Bellson was the
original metal drummer, Gene Krupa Pop, and Buddy Rich was Jazz.

Is it worth doing all this in OBsidian if I implement some sort of review
process?

I think the system I want to start off by trying is:
- Brain dump each day
- Summarize at end of day
- Move to topics end of week

Additioanlly, would be really good if I could just take a day to explore
qhatever I want to explore.

Really want to get a vintage gramophone and old jazz records to get the real
experience 

The solution to finding a recording location where I won't disturb anyone is to
just to it at an axclusive all trails location

Saying someone's name creates this immediately noticeable impression on them,
but it also creates this genuine feeling of connection within. I've noticed
this a lot at Starbucks where customers that I learned the name of would
immediately start opening up to me--within the first couple of visits--about
their life outside. It also created this much easier way of opening up to them
in return. #insight

Still really neeed a water filter and trekking poles

I think my main difficulty in creating a new system is like segmentation.
Trying to differentiate the daily discussions from the more SOC influx. 

I feel like I was sent on this like recovery mission by God today. Like side
quests keep popping up that I want to do, but I have no willpower to deny what
this body wants to do. There's a lot of emotions present and I don't know what
any of them mean. But I'm also so hungry

# 04/28/2025

Need to start trying to understand the difference between stable dullness and
other dullnesses. I think I can recognize dullness when it starts to appear
now, but am having a hard time fighting it (maybe from fatigue) and definitely
don't know how to stabilize it. I think another good thing would plan out what
I want everyday to look like going forward. 

So the intention for this week: Write about a solid business plan for the
12-week bootcamp, and everything I know about drums/how to teach it.

The plan so far is really to target people around my age. 20-30 I feel like i
should really be writing about stuff that is like idk somewhat innovative I
already know the niche yeah but what else do i know about the nice who is
he/she what do they do for a living idk myabe tech jobs i feel like the job
itself is failry arbitrary they probably listen to rock music or punk maybe
even rnb like I'm thinking josh he's a fitness addict I like growth oriented
people so they probably meditate too okay that's something maybe they're
obsessed with growth and do they think they'll be a rockstar one day maybe not
I 'm not sure they're looking to reinvent themselves so much as they just want
to be able to play with friends they see alot of videos online from really good
drummers like ringo starr or travis barker and they're obsessed with their
capabiliities seeing them play so fast i feel like they have a bit of
experience in music but their parents thought it was a waste of time they may
not have a great relationship with their parents but if they do they have a
hidden resentment for not giving them a chance at this so they want to make up
for it now as an adult who has a single/dual income household where they can
reliably pay it forwad pay tribute tot he music community i think theyre fairly
mindful and adaptive they see this as an investment in themselves theyre not
aggressive but they see this as a valuable commodity that theyre finally in a
situation where they can learn to play music which has up until this point been
somewhat of a fantasy they want to learn how to play but have no idea where to
start there's so much ambiguity in youtube videos and they need the structure
of someone who has been on this journey before theyre the type that when they
run a marathon they get a coach to show them the way or if theyre going to hike
up a mountain they take the dangerous trail with someone who has done it before
they find beauty in the journey over the destination and want to explore drums
and music more as a curiosity they drema of getting to play and jam with other
musicians and they want to learn how to continue learning they see this more as
an investment that has a fixed ending and fixed outcome much like any form of
coaching yet they are willing to continue on indefinitely they likee the idea
of a fixed timeline the idea that they are going to reach a goal and the when
they read a flyer saying that by the end of this they will be able to read
music they will be able to pracctice with a meteronome they will be able to
play the boots and cats beats they get excited they feel excited thinking that
they might be able to learn any song that they listen to and play along with it
they get proud showing this to their significant other as something they picked
up its not the same as someone who takes lessons so that they can swoon their
significant other they want to make them dance they want to make them proud 

what is it they expect to learn and what problems do they have my current offer
is that i will teach them how to read music i will teach how to use a
meteronome how to hold the sticks how to carry your weight ergonomically I will
have cheatsheets for all of these things that will assist them as they continue
forward these cheat sheets will use the ergonomics discovered from eyears of
drumming it will guide both traditional and match grips should they be sheets
or videos or both could they be both would that be beneficial idk what problems
do they face drums are too loud theyre not ergonomic they take up too much room
whats the point of learning drums anyway when I could learn guitar why did i
even learn drums in the first place thats actually a really good question i
have no idea the more i think about it the more i think that i learned drums
because guitar wasnt an option why does anyone willingly decide to pick up
drums i was inspired to play drums later on but why would someone actively
choose to pick up drums as a primary instrument theyre loud and obnocious your
neighbors hate you for having them when you're bad people complain about it
yeah but they do that with any instrument you're not special for that i think
something about drums is more of a dance its a full body movement and a workout
its an instrument that connects to the body its a religion yeah but why do
people start playing it who puts the stick in their hands wow this is actually
a really deep insecurity in my mind i can see why teaching has never worked out
before how the hell am i supposed to understand why anyone else would want to
play drums when i didnt even want to play them when i was just kinda coerced
into it thats a crazy realization like there's pop culture drummers now like
questlove and ringo starr and whats his name the ohh chad smith but like why
would anyone venture out on their own to learn drums its not necessarily a
virtuostic instrument its not even really glamorous its the behind the scenes
instrument that holds down the fort its the instrument that is the most
important yet no one paays attention to how can i cater this to people when i
hardly view it highly and see it as being so critical this seems like a very
important distinction

# 04-30-2025

So what is the question today?

I want to expand on this:

> Like why would anyone venture out on their own to learn drums? Its not
> necessarily a virtuostic instrument. Its not even really glamorous. Its the
> behind the scenes instrument that holds down the fort. Its the instrument
> that is the most important yet no one paays attention. To how can i cater
> this to people when i hardly view it highly and see it as being so critical. 

In that vein, why do *I* love playing drums?

I love playing drums because theres some pure connection to the music. Like
melodic instruments are fun to listen to, but I've never known one of them to
make me want to move my body without a percussive element to it. The stomping
of the foot or the slapping of the side. Even in guitar, watching someone try
to mimic the percussiveness is admirable but it never fully recreates the sound
of the drumset the power of the kick beating through your chest the intensity
that you can feel from a rock drummer or the delicacy that you can get from
jazz. The way that a fuk drummer can make your head move the cognitive
distortion you can experience when beats are shifted slightly out of place that
feeling of someone playing slightly out of time but still in the pocket is such
an existential experience as if for a moment its causing your soul to separate
from your body and the fluidity of it too its like watching a ballet or a tap
dancer its like getting to hear the moves that they make its such a profound
instrument but yeah its not glamorous people usually forget about it and it
makes me feel lonely up there it can feel like a burden sometimes being in the
back being expecteed to be perfet and not being able to achieve it its hard
watching everyones backs and playing a show for people where maybe only one of
them will pay attention to you and genuinely that makes me sad looking out into
a crowd or even looking at bandmates and not a single one of them is paying
attention to you because all you are is their time keeper its a thnakless job
most the time but its the most important one the most impactful one the one
they dont see but you can walk away from it everyday feeling like i held this
band together when the egotistical singer talks his way through the crowd and
gets all the women you can have the confidence you made that happen being a
drummer means to be generous it means to be someone who gives gives gives and
never expects anything in return it gives you the power to control how the song
feels the tempo of it the way that each instrument is hit and it makes me sad
to think about how sad i feel with the drums how insecure i feel and
underrepresented i want to cry about it because it almost seems like another
place where ive chosen the lonelest instrument the one that no one pays
attention to the instrument with walls its not that i chose it for those
reasons like i absolutely love drums everything about it the way it feels to
exert that energy i used to come home after a bad day or a breakup and i didn't
want to run i didn't want to cry all i wanted to do was shit myself on the kit
ecause i was playing so much all i wanted to do was play some heavy fucking
rock music or heavy metal and beat all my problems away when i was bullied when
i faced my insecurities all that melted away when Nightmare came on and I could
just move all my limbs as loud and as fast as i can because it was the
instrument of expression its the instrument for those of us that dont have a
voice or havent found it yet its the instrument where they have to pa attention
to you where if you decide youre done everyone will hear it is the most
iportant instrument its the one that you have control over its the one thing
that no one can take away from you you didnt have to be good at it you just
loved being able to sit behind the kit and hammer shit out you didnt even care
if you were good at it or not until recently you just loved playing you always
felt like pride was what drove you forward but pride and anger dont have that
power it was always love you always loved playing you loved the escape you
loved the challenge you loved asking yourself "can I go there" and not stopping
until you you loved the addiction you loved the pain of not being able to
figure it out you loved the experiementation you loved everything about the way
it allowed you express yourself because that was you in those few moments you
could speak your truth in those few moments the universe aligned in your favor
dad couldnt yell at you and mom couldnt bully or belittle you drumming was your
escape and you have the power to give that to someone else you have the power
to channel that expression to teach this skill but why are you so afraid to
teach it why are you trying to hide it why are you so afraid to express
yourself here you love the drumms you hate the drums the drums challenge you
theyve frustrated you youve felt misunderstood as a drummer you have so many
places in your life where you were made to feel insecure behind the kit by the
same bullies that you couldn't stand up to and now that you have to confront
that you have to recognize that they've impacted your ability to play your
ability to take risks your ability to shine on the stage eeryone loves when you
play but you still dont feel like your'e good enough to belong there its
addicting its gratifying its amazing when you get done with a show and they all
tell you how good that show was how your fills popped off but the best feelings
dont come from the stage they come from the conversations you get to have with
your friends about music its like this whole other world opens up this new
understanding for whats interesting whats fun this whole world of excellence
its like anything that expands your mind like running or meditation why dont I
want to pay for lessons of mentorship its not that i dont i just never feel
like i know the right person theres still this barrier here that i dont
understand like theres a heavy resistance that i cant quite explain its like i
still dont know how to talk about why i love drums in a way that i also feel it
most of the stuff ive written here today comes from a place of frustration and
desire where is my peace iwht my drums maybe the truth is that i feel like im
never enough and that contributes to this long running narrative of why i cant
be enthusiastic about drums for others why i always have to fake compliments
maybe i dont understand why i love drums and that frustrates me because ive
committed the rest of my life to doing it but maybe the answer is simple maybe
i dont have to understand it maybe the truth is i love drums maybe the truth is
i hate drums but i dont i love drum circles that feeling of getting to sit
around with a group of people and just jam i love every bit of it but i fail to
recognize how i could convince anyone else to want to play drums when i dont
even understand why i play them like ive never really observed that the
feelings i get from playing drums and even when i observe them i dont feel like
i can do a great job at communicating them other then just saying like it feels
powerful. I think the thing i have a hard part understanding isnt as much the
drum aspect of it as it is like why does anyone try to learn something new
without striving to be the best at it? I mean I guess i dont want to be the
best at running but i do want to run marathons and ultra marathons maybe its
not about being the best as much as the feelings it gives you and i think with
music thats a hard part for me to understand because ive never really lived a
life without music without art what other reasons are there really to study an
instrument i guess just to enjoy it i mean ive said some stuff here that
resonates

Starting out with analysis on this teaching session with Amanda. What is
everything that went wrong?

I dont think really much went wrong but mainly because it lacked direction. I
think alot of wha tI was trying to do was understand where she was in her
career with music. Learning how to teach someone else seems like it's actually
going to be a lot of fun, like I can begin to see where the joy of teaching
comes form. Like seeing where she is and where she can progress is amazing. But
I think it's doing it with intention that I'm confusing myself about. Its
making me realize that i definitely will not be able to take every student that
comes my way mainly because i want to be sure to give her and whoever else im
woring with the premium attention they deserve to succed, the kind of growth
and attention i give to myself is what i want to give to others i guess where i
feel like i went wrong is introductin music theory way too early i didn't have
exercises planned i had a general idea of what i wanted to talk about and what
to go over today but thats about it and i think moving forward its best if i
create some kind of dedicated plan like if i looked at her skills and said what
is the most major eweakness in regards to her goals what would it be honestly
no clue so her goal is just to use the guitar as a form of creation to convy
thoughts in her head through the medium of guitar what are all the skills shes
missing i guess first a basic knowledge of music theory also how to move around
the fretboard and what different chords mean and what different symbols mean
and how to read sheet music and also how to write music but to be fair its not
so much about being able to read and write as it is just being able to
understand what a chord is even without necessarily knowing what each thing
does and playing around with it seeing how they go into each other and stuff
like that idk its really hard to figure out where to go from here so we can
commit to several paths but what is the best one like as a year long plan and 3
month plan and month plan and weekly plan where should we go and howdo we
adjust i think thats the first thing say where should she be a year from now
what is like typical or expected like i dont think we have to get her all the
way to doing stuff like what is too easy what is too hard how do we build more
of repetoire especially with how skilled i am to begin with like i know quite a
bit but mst of what i know is from fucking around on the guitar and finding out
i guess creating a roadmap and a consistent practice schedule should be the
first thing i feel like doing it like my therapis would have done it seems like
the right approach have the settle in a nd warmup period andlet that kind of
guide the discussion I also dont feel like I conveyed everything the way I
wished I had like I wanted to say things so much more like artfully or
poetically maybe I just hadnt thought them through but she understood and lke
it doesnt seem like she had complaints i guess we'll find out as time goes on
what the verdict is but I feel like my rough edges are in the terminology alot
of the time and getting that part clear being able to communicate that sort of
thing well and also some more complicated topics idk im confused i dont really
know how to grow from here like i feel like i look on that lesson thinking yeah
that went pretty well but i think i wished it was more structured in a way not
freeballed it just felt a little frustrating i guess like idk it wasnt really
frustrating like i really eenjoyed almost all of it and i feel like this is an
area where i can really excel but im beginning to see where my faults are and i
want to practice this the same way id practice music  like there were so many
points where I could tell i wasn't able to communicate clearly and effectively
and i feel like that was a failure on my part as a teacher

Okay now for business stuff. I don't really have a question I want to ask
today. What are my insecurities with drumming?

I guess my insecurities with drumming is that ts loud the neighbors get fucking
annoyed and Griffin was such a piece of shit and terrible player that every
time i heard him play i wanted to fuckingkill him he really fucked up drumming
for me because before it was really like play as loud and inconsideratly as you
can but now its like dont break the peace dont do anything to make him start a
conversation with you i feel like im getting away fro the point its not so much
about my insecurities as it is like why do i have a hard time being so excitted
about drums why do i have a hard time sticking up for myself i feel like the
different action i need to take in this scenario is to actually talk to Brandi
like instead of hiding the fact that im distancing myself from her actually own
up to tht efact that i lead her on and now i feel guilty about having done so
and its like now i feel my attnetion beginning to shift because ive realized
that her and i genuinely have nothing to talk about like with Russ it feels
like i have a vested interest in his life outside of work like with everything
else happening and its lie i can just go hike with kevin why is it i have hiked
so many times with Brandi but noever with Andy why is it that ive devoted so
much of my time andenergy to her instead of giving it to the people that i
actually enjoy being around like amanda and david and andy and jaida and momo
and kevin like i fell like im waking up after having been blinded for years now
having stared right at the sun having confronted someone who has no
conversational dynamic with me outside of just complaining about all the guys
shes with its like the glamour has suddenly faeed and i realize the reason im
always so anxious around her is because i feel this constant judgement i feel
just fucking bored like i have absolutely nothing to say when im not bullying
her i have nothing to talk bout nothing at all and ive escaped my intentions
unfortunatly but ive been meaning to talk about this like what else am i
insecure about with drumming or with anything i think its a confidence issue
its weird i enjoy teaching now that im getting more used to it i need a better
rasp on it still but its nice having students who are such good listeners
anyways idk idk idk whatother insecurities i have while drumming like i
definitely have a lot which it hin makes it even harder to start something i
also just cant tell what is wrong like i need ot proress here and i thnk im
looking for more part of the problem is i didnt review this yesterday and im
definitely not going to be able to today so its like all the questions and
curiosities are evading me idk i feel like there are much deeper insecurities
tied to self esteem and confidence and i feel like with the people ive been
surrounded with before it makes sense idk what it is theres still alot of pride
there maybe its shit that just needs to be let go of im unceratin i dont know
what to write about right now i dont even really unerstand what the point of it
all is God please help me i need help understanding and pushing through all
this getting this business up and running i feel like I'm so fucking close but
I still don't completely understand what the core package is and how to
advertise it like i thnk through Amanda I realize that I dont have to solve
every problem right away but I still can't really imagine why someone would
pick up the drums in the first place i still dont even really understand groove
oriented genres which to me is the main reason to pick it up i feel like I'm
somewhere in between trying to learn why other people start playingdrums and
learning why I  play in the first place and its really a perplexing puzzle to
me

The trick to holding to sticks is just to make a fist with the stick in it,
then move the thumb up and loosen the fingers.

Okay so I didn't scome up with much of a promt to day but I still need to
continue this one thing i know i need to work on is mainly just answering all
the questions and the problems that others could have so what are more problems
that i may have not thought about before what were my problems is ego drumming
a main problem i think people see speed and want to play fst what bout getting
gigs are they really intent on having a gig right off the bat or maybe no even
that maybe just people to jam with like do they already have alot of friends
that play and feel self concious about ont being able to play how do they go
about finindg new musicians if they aren't already involved in a group do other
people tend to go out of their way to find new communities or are they home
bodies are they dopamine slaves i feel like anyone trying to play and
instruemtn isnt a dopamine slave like amanda wants to learn to plapy to express
herself more creatively are there alot of people like that like some people
decorate houses some people do gardens some people just love art like brandi
likes painting and stuff like that like i feel like more holistic pelle want to
learn instruments especially onse they have played before but why drums
speicifically like what problems do they have i feel like i really dont know
how to get the answer to this question maybe the problem isnt coming up with
the solution on my own so much as actually asking people learning drums whats
stopping them like is there a way i can get a focus group together or some kind
of study where i go out and learn whats preventing people from actually picking
up drums like what are the biggest factors i feel like for most people its
sound like having a place to actually go and play i dont think most people
carea bout mastery so much as getting their heart out so like maybe i also need
to find a study talking about the health benefits of drumming or even use my
own recordings or something because there are alot of calories burned in
drumming like an hour show is at least 300 calories which is alot more than any
other dinstrument but yea like i feel like i understand my issues with drumming
mainly the too loud the space the ergonomics but beyond that what are all the
other resistances like when i first got my kit why did it take 6 months for me
to play it i think because personally i felt like i needed permission to play
it like i had the kit and i was drawn to it but i didn't even know how to set
it up but i remember after that first lesson danny taught me how to set up the
set completely and it was like having someone with knowledge tell me how to sit
at a kit was all i needed to actually sit and play and i remember after that i
went home and practiced playing for like a week straight and its like he also
taught me alot about just listening to music to hear and pick out the notes
understand whats being played but most of what drove me forward was my own
drive and curioiusty something thats been there since the beginning and i feel
like with amanda something thats really going to help is having a song to
demonstrate all this wiwth like having something to work towards understanding
her music a little better especially but yeah idk what other problems do
beginners face what are their resistances to practice maybe time constraints
but 2 minutes is all it takes max 20 minutes a day to begin with its just about
playing and getting better later be more dilligent later maybe all they need is
permission to start to be told that congradulations now youre officially a
drummer youre allowed to do whatever the fuck you want now and no one can say
otherwise maybe theyre afraid because their parents discouraged art as
meaningless when its so full of meaning its so fully beauty and spirituality
like being told that drums is a way of communicating with the Gods has really
been one of the most impactful things ive heard in a long tim from Jojo and the
Rumero its fascinating hearing about this whole other life style this religiion
of drumming how do i continue to spread the love when i cant even understand
the problem how can li create something valueable that they feel dumb rejecting
it thats the question im trying to answer and truthfully i have no idea because
its been so long since ive touched and instrument so like how do you even get
answers to ghis question how do you find the case study who do you ask when you
don't have a following how do you get an answer to this like i have 300
followers on instagram but none of them can answer this question because all of
them already play instruments this is directed to an entirely different
audience of people who have never touched a drum set or who are just starting
it maybe they have a kit maybe they dont its possible they played uitar before
its possible they havent who even wants drum lessons like i love the groove and
the rhythm the feeling of making someone dance the power of commanding a room
the power to control the band i no longer fear the power i once felt victim to
i feel like im gaining a much broader control over it in an influential way not
to be confused with domineering or manipulation or abuse of authority i just
feel like i understand the instrument i posess and the respect for what i do
but what do they want they want a glimpse of that power they live in a world
where that power was taken away from them where their voice was silenced they
lived in a world where they had to ask permission all their life to be
themselves and they finally want an outlit where they can be whoever they want
to be and be heard doing so they want to feel themselves and they want everyone
in the room to feel the groove that they eminate the rhythm they walk to they
want to inspire they want to connect and live hramoniously they want to be a
trusted backbone a supportive cahrracter a generous mind for the world of
musicians and the life they live. #soc

The trick to holding to sticks is just to make a fist with the stick in it,
then move the thumb up and loosen the fingers. #technique #drums Jojo Mayer in
his TedX talk about 0 to 1 discusses how drums were one of the two primary
forms of communication, the other being the voice. The advent of the drum set,
industrial machinery, and recording equipment brought rhythm to the forefront
of communication. The invention of drum machines further synthesized what a
drummer was capable of and try to simulate what a real drummer would play. That
was until Jungle and DnB music which sought to invent a whole new genre that
surpassed the previous limitations of drummers. Jojo Mayer's big goal was to go
beyond the human limitations and imitate what the machiens were playing, in the
same way that early drummers would imitate machinery, yet add a human component
to them, something more emotional and which would allow for simple
improviation. #drums #drumhistory #innovations

A big part of #investigativejournalism is to actually just explore with
curiosity constantly, allowing each source to paint part of a bigger picture.

[The origins of Cuban Salsa, Rumba and Bembe - A story told by a rumbero - Dr
Yabu Kenke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du15n1kO4i8) Most of the details of
the story talk about how drumming is a way of communicating with the Gods.
Similar to what Jojo Mayer was saying, drums are used to communicate over
longer distances. They are loud so the Gods can hear us, and is a form of
communion with them. Its a connection to the spirituatl realm  #bembe

What about a book that unconciously reinforces good practice habits? Like the
15 min per day guitar book, but for drums? Or even, what about building a
lessons plan which helps to build general skills everyday? Like one day for
dynamics, one for grid, etc. #ideas #drums #books

Starting to get alot more wrist movement in left hand, which is making me aware
of the fact that alot of my problems have stemmed from how little wrist
movement i had before. Still need to work on more fluidity with it though,
letting it flow a bit more instead of exclusively moving with the wrist
(relying on pivot more) #drums #progress

Just now realizing that the shuffle rhythm in Talk Down by Dijon is a variation
of the Bembe rhythm. That's awesome! Starting to see the synoptic connections.
