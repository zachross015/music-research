There's so much in my head today that I just have to dump it all out. Looking to go through the following
- Tackling Sales insecurities
- Building more of an authentic offer based on what I already do rather than what I want to do
- Figure out who I want to be in Her
- Finding ways to improve the lessons I'm already doing
- Resistance to meditations
- How to make onboarding easy and enthusiastic
- Fear in helping to connect others
- Ways entertainment has connected or saved my life
- Ways that indefinite coaching has impacted my life
- Undercurrent of sales being a way of directly asking someone to give me money, which Ive always had a hard time with. Trying to rephrase it
- Pride issues

Okay so I have 3 business gardens total right now. Gigs, lessons, and sessions. My energy is devoted, almost entirely, to none of them. It's all focused on growth *in general* rather than growing any plant specifically. I still am seeking general growth on the instrument, but the more valuable I become to my current industry the easier it will be to free the time for general growth.

## Gigs 

Most of my gross revenue has come from this garden. I now charge $100/hr for this minimum unless specified otherwise.

Current clients: Spare Change, Isra, Parking Garage(?)
Previous clients: Highway 49, Patio, Tabla Rosa

###

## Lessons

Consistent revenue comes from this garden. It's much smaller because it is my youngest garden, but it is already more consistent and gratifying than the others.

Current clients: Amanda, Elaina
Previous clients: None

## Sessions

No income has been generated from this route.

Current clients: Spare Change, Jackson, Parking Garage(?)
Previous clients: None

I think the overwhelming sentiment moving forward is I'm going to have to ask for feedback from everyone I've played with to find ways to continue improving. Fuck! Actually, it might be good to open this poll to everyone on insta. Something like asking what their dream outcome is when hiring a drummer, percieved likelihood of getting that outcome, the time delay(?), and effort/sacrifice. The last two I'm not exactly sure how to measure. But it would be good to make one for people looking to hire drummers versus what a fan is looking for? Like to understand both sides of the coin for improvement. And measure these against what people I've played with are looking for. And with that it's like what more can I do to increase their security?

So this is the main thing I need to improve gigs and sessions. Lessons I feel is a different story.

Also, how do I corner the micromarket? Like the Athens market, how do I become the GOTO guy for gigs, sessions, and lessons?

I guess the ideal is that I'm an all in one package. Hiring me *pulls* a crowd too. The band profit as much as I do. It's not just hiring a drummer, it's hiring an audience. How do I become someone that pulls a crowd? How do I do so with the least effort?
- Text everyone I know in the area
- Consistently provide the best experience possible
- Sell shows better
	- What is the grand slam offer for a show? Especially one that I'm hosting?
	- How do I get over the selling insecurities?
- Daily instagram commenting (watering plants) ONLY FOR GENUINE CONNECTION NOT FOR MANIPULATION
- Referall deals ($50 to whoever refers, engineer or fellow musicians for gigs)
- Share the wealth wherever possible!!!
