"I got the chance a few years ago to watch a famous trainer work with his thoroughbreds. I had
imagined that the process would be something hard-core like Navy SEAL training. To my surprise, the sessions were more like play.
The work was serious, as in teaching the two-year-olds to enter the starting gate, and the horses were definitely learning. But the trainer took pains to make the schooling feel like fun. When a horse got tired, the trainer took him off the track. If a mount got bored or restive, the trainer never forced him to continue or drove him “through the pain.”
He explained:
A horse is a flight animal. Even a stallion, if he can, will choose flight over confrontation.
Picture the most sensitive person you’ve ever known; a horse is ten times more sensitive. A horse is a naked nervous system, particularly a thoroughbred. He’s a child. A three-yearold, big and fast as he is, is a baby. Horses understand the whip, but I don’t want a racer that runs that way. A horse that loves to run will beat a horse that’s compelled, every day of the week.
I want my horses to love the track. I want my exercise riders to have to hold them back in the morning because they’re so excited to get out and run.
Never train your horse to exhaustion. Leave him wanting more."

"The professional refuses to be iconized. Not for selfish reasons, but because he knows how destructive the dynamic of iconization is to the iconizer. The pro will share his wisdom with other professionals—or with amateurs who are committed to becoming professionals."

"In a way I was lucky that I experienced failure for so many years. Because there were no
conventional rewards, I was forced to ask myself, Why am I doing this? Am I crazy? All my friends are making money and settling down and living normal lives. What the hell am I doing? Am I nuts? What’s wrong with me?
In the end I answered the question by realizing that I had no choice. I couldn’t do anything else. When I tried, I got so depressed I couldn’t stand it. So when I wrote yet another novel or screenplay that I couldn’t sell, I had no choice but to write another after that. The truth was, I was enjoying myself. Maybe nobody else liked the stuff I was doing, but I did. I was learning. I was getting better.
The work became, in its own demented way, a practice. It sustained me, and it sustains me still."

Not a bad #idea to do a documentary series with Evan on different drumming styles
