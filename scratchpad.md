The big idea I'm recieving now while building out this offer is BE OKAY WITH FAILING. Have an idea, try it out. If it doesn't work, it doesn't. Like I'm trying to build the 90 day jam-ready offer, and I'm going into it having the mindset now that I'm going to have a general idea of what should be covered by when, but now concrete ideas or evidence yet of works. They will help me improve.
