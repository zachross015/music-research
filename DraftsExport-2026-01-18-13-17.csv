I think what I mean by this is going into it I had the impression that all the double notes or the double plays in the 68 pattern were the only parts of time being stretched like if you were playing all of the clave pattern in end of itself at that time remain fixed to like metronomic time, whereas the kind of transfer between the two that happens in the diddle that's the only part of time that gets stretched you know brought forward or backwards, but I think the more I play it the more I realize that there's there's like an interpolation between the 6/8 pattern and the four or four pattern, where the only consistent thing is the cycle and everything else that rely that lies in between repetitions of the cycle can be stretched, however, needs to be necessary. The only thing is that it should remain consistent with time, but it can go in between every note being played exactly with like what a metronome would play, and every note being Played almost with little fluctuation, it gets interpreted between every note being played completely metronome and on the other side, every note getting complete plate completely in the same amount of space

I think one other aspect of this is looking at the ways in my life has been so far shaped and away that has been outside of any kind of rhythm. For about two years now, I've also struggled to like get into any kind of flow or Rhythmic state or any kind of consistency and structure because my scheduling has been unpredictable for work and so I've used that as an excuse not to develop any kind of structured to the life I was living. I think I felt like because I was flexible with work. I had to be un flexible in the way that I… I think I felt because I needed flexibility from work. I couldn't expect to develop any kind of structure around it and so I think in getting better at learning how this bell pattern incorporates to the rhythms of the world and also to the consistency of like the ceremonies and how they're developed to help me in my own life to understand how to build a more consistent structure that I could rely on you know things like attending jam sessions, and run clubs… Building space in them every week that I could rely on showing up to these things and being able to socialize with the same people all the time. It's not it's not something I felt like I could really understand before and it's funny how it evolves from just sitting around playing a rhythm for 45 minutes straight and understanding, what kind of cultural context has evolved from that?","",0,false,Markdown

I've been reading *music: A Subversive History* by Ted Gioia and...WOW. I'm reading this as part of an everlasting pursuit to deepen my relationship with and love for music and WOW. In connection with research on the Bembe, one of the most prominent ideas is tha of an *audience*. In the book, Ted talks about how the concept of an audience, one that separates performer from those observing, is a recent and detached evolution of music. In folkloric music, there was no distance between the two. Gonna brain dump. There was a shamanistic approach and view where music itself was deemed altering. It was a means of combating more dangerous and deadly prey by singing out in unison the song of your people, and after the slaughter it became a way of preserving or celebrating the life of the animal that had given itself to them. In the rituals it was a way of creating unity, synchronizing with the tribe, and honoring the Gods above and I find that so magical and fascinating especially in comparison to how it's approached nowadays where we either idolize an artist on our phones or go to a concert and watch them perform on a stage people going around saying ""I don't know how to play music"" or ""im not a musician"" without realizing that to be human is to be a musician in the tribal times music was how we survived how we got on the same page it was synchronization it was how we fought prey and scared of predators by joining our voice in unity and it's been reduced to profit by people who don't respect the culture of where it's come from what it's capable of but I see more and more with Bembe when I play it and collect others to play it with me why it's so powerful why the groove is necessary because in playing the rhythm over and over again even by yourself you sink into it it feels heavier and you are able to lose yourself in it you get to a point where you don't have to think about it you relax and you play and you only gain awareness again when you slip out when you fall away having played this for over an hour a day even passively on a camping trip I've been on so I've been on this camping trip with my friends and instead of neglecting my studies my life has grown in a way where I feel inspired to continue growing so frequently as we adventured through different forests beaches swamps and other terrains I found myself asking ""what is the song of this area?"" The book I've been talking about has completely expanded my definition of music and song beyond the 4-piece ensembles and entertainment-exclusive perception I've had for it up until now. I walked through each ecosystem trying to identify the plant life and animal like by the sounds they made and although I'd always been into mediation, I'd never before experienced a deepening of appreciation for the world we'd lived in quite like this. In Continuation of the Lesson I learned about the unity of the frogs croaking to ward off prey but from the concepts in Ted's book it also seems like the unity of songs from human could be used as powerfully as a weapon, scaring off lions and other predators and stealing away their kills. But everywhere I went, I found myself sinking into the Bembe bell rhythm. I'd play on the railings of boardwalks, the console of the car we'd rode around in, and finally by the fireside where me and one of my friends played the bell pattern and shekere rhythm with each other. Even now I feel the pulse moving through my mind trying to find a place to get out. It's through doing this and relaxing into this that I feel like I finally understand being in groove. Not only with the music, but in the sense of being in unity. Listening. Being in groove is a respectful thing it's about recognizing and appreciating the rolls of other members in an ensemble or present tribe and appreciating each members part while playing your own. The bell player is the time keeper because they haven't yet developed the capacity to hear the changes and to respect the sanctity of the ritual, and it seems until you can fully play the part on autopilot and stay in groove, it's until you...you're not promoted until you have the capacity to recognize your role and to continue fully contributing to that role. The shamanic powers only come about through holding the synchronization which can only happen when no forces try to dominate, no forces try to impress, and everyone works together to support the ensemble. It's through cooperation that we thrive.

And it all makes me look back on my past. The other thing I know now that I struggled with is performativeness. I think I somewhat struggle socially now because I'm at the tipping point between who I was and who I want to be. I've been hyper aware during social events because my old response was to gut out drama, to search for people's darkness almost as a way of feeling better than them. To be their therapist. I felt that's what deep connection was. But now, I want something different. I want those deep connections, but from a place of joy and comfort and happiness and unity. And I think I got so used to uncovering darkness tha now I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to move in the opposite direction. I think it brings out that whole attraction issue because it's like vulnerable, it's different, it's not who I used to be, I don't want it to be fake but it feels fake. I also don't want to lead anyone on AND I'm terrified of being in a relationship. Crazy layingit all out like that. There's something else I can't remember. OHH the other aspect of it is like trying to manage other peoples emotions?  Used to think it was empathy, but now I usually just feel like it's a self defense thing. Not just managing emotions, but really any form of protecting people from
The consequences of their actions and/or molding them to my rules

Not only that, but to know there are such cheap ways to explore and enjoy the world. Like we don't need more than what's in a car to survive. Some tents, some laughs, and some good music.

We listened to Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Dijon, and many other bands all the way down. Singing along with them too! It feels weird because I feel so happy, but there's some kind of edge to it. Almost looking to spoil it.

- Don't try
- Listen frequently to newer and newer music
- Don't abandon the baseline. Set it, play it enough that you can completely let go of it, then free your mind for playing on top of it
- Be the bell player at first. 
- Music hasn't changed all that much from back then. Get into the flow of the music and let changes come exclusively from intention instead of fear or pain
- You have to get to a point where you're not anxious about over or underplaying. Where you're listening to exactly what the audience is listening to. Where you're not reacting to every single thing and are instead contributing exactly your part to the greater whole with intention. Fills or accents then just become a way to add color not a necessity to bring attention to yourself. But it all starts with playing the time keeper until that is second nature, then you can free your mind to receive information.
- not being afraid of playing a small, but vital, role

I used to be afraid to change the world because I thought it was an ego thing and didn't want to take the responsibility for doing so. Now I feel like I HAVE to change the world, and I want to work towards doing so responsibly.

Like I'm the one who helps makes things happen now. When we were talking about camping, I'm the one who puts the plans together. Building business, it's me who plans out the path and walks it. There's almost a dual benefit to being the planner that comes in tandem with planning camping trips. It's not about having everything, it's about lean survival to get you to a destination.

I'm saying this all from a point of like...I'm so proud right now. It's like every second I claim back from the dopamine addiction gets put towards actually making progress in the activities and things I want to do. And I want to do it everywhere, reclaiming all the spent resources in other categories of my life and devoting them towards the future. It's so fucking exciting feeling the momentum I'm living in. _the groove_. It makes me feel like even through the stress, I can't trust myself to do and achieve anything. Because more and more, I've been able to complete things in spite of resistance or what I want to do in the moment. And it doesn't have to be lofty, but it has to be true.

It's probably the biggest benefit I've gotten from meditation.

I really love you right now Zach. Thank you for everything. We're at the beginning of an amazing part of our lives. It's all beginning to show.

One final thing is that I've begun seeing more of the reason the bell role is the time keeper. It's about getting to a point of playing that's completely autonomous. You don't even have to think about it. You get so in groove that time doesn't change with your emotions or anything else, you completely fall in line to the cycle and never lose the groove. Other people can then completely rely on you because they also fall into the groove, and it's like being in the middle of this meditative trance where everyone is locked in without a thought

Play the rests with as much force as the notes. True in music and in life, know when to take a break

Predilections and urges are minimal today. Cute girl with cute shoes in the lobby, admired her but haven't felt the need to keep checking. Even last night, seeing the shoe displays did very little. Progress!

Can we make every performance a meditation in that way? Where we exclusively focus on the groove and giving in to time

I feel like getting into groove right now is a heavy focus exercise right now. Lots of concentrated effort. But I feel like it's meant to be a flow state.

And alongside this, I've been… I think, focusing on playing the single part over and over has really made me lean into groove rather than focus on like any kind of virtuality or like soloistic playing it makes more and more sense. Why the bad bell rhythm was given to the beginners and I think it's because it's the role where you don't necessarily have to have the ear to know where you fit a place it's the timekeeping is constant and what matters is that you can kind of do it on auto pilot and let everyone else kind of adjust to you and I mean you still have to be stable with it but I think going into it. I thought you're going to have to put the most stable person on it, but it seems more like you put the person who still has to develop their ear on it? Where is the other parts? It seems more vital that they know how and when to interject different rhythms I think because it is a music where the music itself isn't necessarily the focal point it's like background for singing and dancing it playing something consistently for long periods of time seems to be the most important part

I think the big thing it's changing with my mind is the concept of when and how to use Phil's to enhance music because in the context if you're playing like a Bebe bell pattern, you're not supposed to fill at all you just play the same pattern over and over maybe you'll change it up a little bit but pretty much the whole ceremony is you playing that one over and over cause you're the anchor for everyone else and so now when I've gone back to try and jam with other songs, I find myself more often than not staying away from using any fills and even playing less notes because it feels like it fits into the groove more not only that, but I also feel like there's a much greater emphasis on listening to other people in the music around you when you're having to play this bell powder and over and over again you know you get to a point where you don't have to think about it anymore so it's more important to kind of lose yourself in the Group instead of I've been trying to do this more when I play other music too by playing in a way that is consistent enough that I can lose myself in the groove and really focus on what other people are playing and I find that doing that makes playing a lot more simple and really just more enjoyable. I think the thing I struggled with it still kind of struggled with going into this is the idea that coming from like a virtual stick background or even like a one where I played solar work it feels weird, giving up the agency of fills and solos because there's almost this sphere that you lose yourself in the process or you become obsolete or unimaginative, but I think the farther and I get the more I realize that that's completely not the case like if anything you become more stable and more coordinated and more reliable in the role you're playing and you begin to hear how your accents and your films can complement people or transition things rather than just acting as a way of fiddling around","",0,false,Markdown

It's probably one of my favorite businesses. In part because it's a member owned and in another part because you go in there and you get the sense of adventure, you know you get this feeling like you could survive anywhere and when I go in, I start thinking and imagining like what life could look like you know a couple years from now and it's full of just like these adventures you know what I've when I look at it. I look at it from like the place that I am now and it's so exciting to think about planning and preparing an adventure that only requires you to have a tent in a bed and the rest is kind of up to you like isn't that just so amazing? You can go anywhere you could do anything like you could backpack for days just having like supplies to carry you through it and I think the games I played growing up that's what I'd liked about them was like you know monster Hunter, going into an area having fully prepared your equipment and you know brought like potions you needed and stuff like that to conquer whatever you're going to conquer it feels that way with REI and going like backpacking and camping. It's like you're taking your life with you and you're facing the elements but like it's not that dangerous of a thing or at least not when you know what you're doing I just get like so fucking excited walking out of there thinking like you know I could get all this camping equipment I could find people who will go on these adventures with me. You know go plan and prepare and then go out for like a weeklong hiking expedition where we bring our own food and we cook our own food on the trail and we walk and we enjoy nature without needing really anything else like it's a reminder of where we've come from like I think you get so used to believing that you need all this superfluous stuff like technology video games are sugar, addictions, or social media or something but it's like the minute. You're out there you're on your own and you realize you don't need any of It.

Looking at that it makes me wonder how I could bake that experience into Rhythmic. You know a place where you have community and you go there and you feel like you could do anything like you could write whatever song you wanted to write you could become famous doing so like I think it's what guitar center was supposed to be, but I never feel like that way going in there I feel like I don't know weird going in there. It's weird because Rhythmic is in a retail place or maybe it could be one day but like I don't know I feel like working on it so much today I got inspired thinking about everything it could be for people that come to it it's like I have to start, but I don't know. I think barking through a lot of it today I started to see like more progress that could be made and I feel like I have a good starting point especially for the website, I have a good starting point I'm not necessarily happy or set on the color scheme because I feel like I've come up with like a better idea of what I wanted to look like, but I like the font and it's hard because like I wanted it to be vibrant, but I wanted to feel like a sunrise, you know the start of a new day and a calm morning like I feel like what I want to embark on people is a feeling of opportunity I guess or a new beginning or something. I think I like what I like about REI if you go in there, it doesn't matter how old you are. It feels like you're ready to go you could start and you can camp and you can do whatever or bike or whatever and it's like how do I get that feeling with this place? Maybe not exactly you know like I looked at all the other websites and I feel like it's a bunch of the same message it's like we have open availability will come to you and we have professionals working here. Maybe I'm naïve, but I don't think that's what people are looking for you know I don't think that's the language. I think people wanna know that they're gonna learn something anyways I don't know. I was thinking about the website and I want to revamp the offer a bit cause I mean right now it's just here's what you're gonna get out of it and here's who I am and I feel like the part that's gonna stand me out. The most is the fact that it's a face in a name like they know who they're getting it's not just interfacing with the company. It's a real person with a real personality and that personality is shown on the website, but I guess I wanna know like I don't know cause I was looking at all of dolls thing and I keep thinking like maybe I should call the Rhythmic community like joining the Rhythmic community but is that deceptive? Is that wrong like I don't know if that's gonna work as well. It's worth like playing around with you AB testing.","",0,false,Markdown

Is it better to take all ive written and write from scratch? Or categorize and cut down?

I wanted to write a final bit for the article. I'm writing today and that is that I've come to this realization that one of the most important parts of Bamba or any kind of folklore genre comes from the fact that there was no metronomes at a time, there was no way of understanding the difference between like hard set time and like relative time and so the way people kept time was really relative to each other there was also no concept of you know apply to a met like there's your time relativity was based on fitting in a in a group so when other people were playing, it was about having enough space to have this many notes in between it was about making room that way and I think coming from a period where we've had Mets for so long it puts us kind of at a disadvantage for learning this genre of music because or at least it puts me at a disadvantage for learning the music because I'm so used to playing precisely with a metronome that leaning into the way that they relax time is is completely different getting to the groove is not necessarily about playing precisely with a metronome so much as it is understanding like tendencies to move and we've and really just focusing on other things and I kind of got a glimpse of this when I was learning jazz. The idea that you shouldn't listen to yourself as much as you should get to a point where you don't have to listen to yourself at all I think taking a step back and only playing one drum part which is the Bamba Bell rhythm forces me to let go of my part. It makes it much easier to focus on what other people are doing because I'm not having to focus on my entire body. I'm just having to focus on getting the groove right on this one part and when I play along to other kind of Bemba adjacent material, I can zone in on the Shaker rhythm or the con rhythms the Kinto rhythms, Trey, scope, rhythms and stuff like that and I think by doing that it's giving me a better sense of time

I think there's an important level trying to navigate how to use something like ChatGPT effectively here and as much as I don't really appreciate its use case in my creative scenarios. I think there is a way to use it to better ourselves as musicians and so the part I've been trying to ponder without relying exclusively on ChatGPT is, what does it mean to get into groove? What are the kind of practices I need to get better at Bamba and any Afro Cuban, John rum and I do feel like there are insights from ChatGPT that aren't necessarily like from a place of understanding but they're also they're from a place of giving you information that you may not have known and one of the main things that it is brought to my attention is the idea of respect in playing this genre you know back then there was a Drum hierarchy in that you started off as the Bamba Bell until you could understand the nuances of it and then you moved up To some other pattern and then he moved up to Congo's and eventually made your way up to Kinto and the biggest part I'm taking away from this is that I don't understand why and so one of my big practices has been going back and exclusively playing the Bombay bell pattern for 30 minutes straight to kind of give myself the feeling of being in one of these ensembles or something and I feel like even and just doing that a little bit, I've I've earned a deeper respect for the groove and not losing the groove because a lot of times in these rhythms they're not changing the entire time throughout the whole ceremony especially the bell pattern. It says consistent and it's everything else that's changing around it and I think learning to adhere to that and stick completely to it and hear the way that space is played between each note changes a lot of perspective on time and group play and teamwork. And to add to all like the Metronic stuff, you know there was no metronome, and so the only way to play in time was to synchronize yourself with other people and I think it comes from a time. Period. Where people were already in sync within a tribe they were communicating with each other in this way, and I think somewhere along the way we… I lost that and in an effort to get better at it, I've been joining a run club and jazz jam group to try and force myself to connect better with other people or at least get better at learning how to be a part of some kind of inner play.

So every year I journey into a new genre of music for drumming. Um, and part of developing a synoptical knowledge of different genres. Something I learned from how to read a book. This year I wanted to cover Bende. For this year, I wanted to cover after keeping drumming. And so I'm starting out with Bambay. Full disclosure I started last year, learning a bit about this stuff. And doing research, I found these videos of, I'm sure they're not, uh, traditional bed bag ceremonies. They're more just dancing ceremonies. But they are traditional African ceremonies, and there's something. Inspiring, awesome. We're in this world where. Sometimes it seems like we're driven further and further apart. There's still this connectivity, you know, these people, they come out, into the streets, for song and dance. And they're somehow able to bring a light to music with just drums. And then singing and dancing. And the vocals end up being some of the most beautiful locals I've ever heard. And I wanted to show you guys this or I wanted to show you this because. I haven't seen it in many places. It goes back to this idea of simple patterns. You know, something that Frank Wiener says in his book. about after keeping drumming is that all African drumming is in some form 68. Meaning that everything inspired from. That Aphrodisporic drumming. Has come from 68 including anything you hear in the US. And I still don't really quite understand what that means. But I do with Benbe, and um. Yeah, but going back to the simple powders, it's interesting seeing how worlds of music have been inspired by Esklave pattern. that 1st appears in these ceremonies. How are the, um, the cowbell pattern. simplified into a closet. And then with her throughout all the time.

One of the 1st things you might notice when investigating Afro-Cuban or any really aphrodisporic. Music. Is the lack of any, like... Basically, what I'm trying to say is, notice that the shake array plays weird six tooth notes. It's not strictly on the beat, but it's... Like, there's a little bit of delay on one of the notes. I haven't quite figured out which one it is yet but... Everything they do, everything that's come from drones, from them. Somehow imitates, like, the physics of the instruments that they were based on.

It's gorgeous outside right now. I can hear the birds chirping. It's like 6:30 a.m. I just got halfway through a run, had to quit. 'Cause I was unprepared. Definitely don't feel like I have enough water in me. And then I ate pretty poorly last night, and I didn't really, you know, eat a banana or anything to get the day started. I think living at Nana's is good for me, for a couple weeks, because it kind of begins to shine holes in places that I was able to get away with at home. You know, for one. All the food is reliant on me. So, whereas before, I was able to get away with snacking on things, it'll be nice to, I think, be bathed in this challenge. where I have full control over what I'm eating. But I think it means they need to be more diligent about, like, you know, picking up bananas and stuff. Um. What else? And I also need uh, some kind of water vest. Or something because, like, can't keep going on these runs dehydrated. Because it's not the 1st one this week. Like the runs are getting harder, but not because I think they're getting more difficult. I think it's just because I'm not preparing for them well enough. And I think the thing that keeps coming to mind now. That, in order to achieve my goals, a lot of times it's not just about taking on that new thing, it's about what am I willing to give up to get there. And a lot of times it's just becoming willing to do whatever that thing is. You know, in the context of running, it's like, am I willing to give up junk food. in the context of a relationship. It's kind of like, am I willing to give up masturbation, and stuff like that. On the other side of it, though, like, I don't know, all these things, I don't, I don't necessarily see is a bad thing anymore. It's like, it's like a challenge. You know, it's no different from living somewhere else. Or practicing a different genre of music. It's like, all of a sudden, you're thrown into new territory. And that's where everything changes. It's like, that's where you become a more consistent version of yourself and kind of round out in ways. And, like, with the whole thing, with quitting social media and masturbation, you know, I keep talking about it, but there's this whole, um, Movement, I guess, like inward movement towards real connection where I'm not, like, necessarily afraid of attraction anymore. In fact, I like lean into it. Whereas before, I think having social media is a crutch, because when I couldn't do anything about it in real life, I could just go there, and look at whatever I wanted, and somewhere it was on the internet, especially when AI started becoming part of the conversation, like, you really could just make anything you wanted to see. Pinterest was, like, really dangerous for me. And I think it makes you delusional. Makes you think, like, oh, this is what all of them look like, and then it just makes all of them look bad. People, I mean. Whereas now, it's like... There's this poll to go places and beat around people. Anyway.

The fascinating part of Bembe, to me, is seeing it as this kind of original root of everything that's kind of been inspired in Cuba, you know, not for keeping it based on, like, the rhythms of the Yoruba tribes. And the clava itself just kind of came from the... dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. So seeing how that's evolved over time into, not only different subgenres of music, but... Mike. How it's inspired. So much music, especially a jazz fusion, is crazy. I don't remember what I was gonna go with this. I keep having this thought, this idea that I need to, like, talk through, and... get ready for the blog, so I can never remember what it is.

It may just be because I don't really know anything about the time period. But one of the most fascinating parts about listening to something like Sunday music, is that... No one person, no single part stands out. Well, it seems like there might be roles to differentiate between. The melody. And the power of this song all come as a result of like communal playing. No one part really takes the spotlight. And I think it makes sense. If that music is coming from a place where people had to rely on each other, where people in these tribes, no person stood out as an individual, everyone was part of a community and played a bigger role in. The growth in the survival of that community. I think in that sense, Music has changed. towards individualism. And I think virtualosity came about. when people started being able to become and survive as individual work. Maybe not necessarily, like, survive as individuals, but believe that they could survive as an individual. Or something like that. And it's something I notice more and more. As I get older, especially in the time we live in. Where, we have a culture, that kind of promotes, Isolation. And being an individual. And I noticed this in my own plane, too, where I felt there was a glamour. To being an individual. Which made some of the listening to this music at 1st really foreign to me because I couldn't figure out where the solos were. Or, where... Like the melody lines were. You know, I was so fixated on looking for a moving part. And it's not that there aren't any. But I was so fixated on looking for some kind of moving part. that at first, I missed the point of it entirely. And that there is no... really moving parts. It just... The purpose of the music is to... be a part of something. in the middle of it. And part of the foundation of it. And I think in starting to understand that better, I can take that everywhere I go, where it's not just about playing well, but playing the part that is invisible. yet means the most. And I realize I still have a lot to learn. And there must be some kind of reason why, you know, people just starting to play in these ceremonies, we're always just given the cowbell roll, or the Benbe Bell roll. And it's something I want to gain insight from. But it makes me wonder if we'll ever be able to have that level of understanding of the music. When our culture is constantly pushing us towards... Being an individual. and trying to emphasize I don't know, 'cause I think about, like, specifically things like ChatGPT and social media. It's like there was a time, before these things where, everything had to be done by someone else, and you had to communicate with people. You had to talk with people. But the thing is, everything you did was part of community. And nowadays, it just feels like... everything you do, you just ask a machine to do for you. And it gets to a point where... you're not even talking to people. You're just... asking a computer to do your work for you. And then. You hop on social media and you talk to... Essentially, your phone all day. Watching other people do things. It's isolating. And I'm kind of getting off topic, and I don't really care anymore.

A couple more insights from running today. One... It takes... I'm trying to be social. A little bit every time. Two... The wig that I prepare for a long run. It's the way that most of these people prepare for every day. Or at least going in with the intention to do your own practice... That's the wrong thing. To the runner. Even running is an opportunity to talk and to connect. That's about letting go. You intended it, you. And traveling with the pack? Because that's as much of an opportunity to connect. to grow relationships. I stand at the start of the morning, something happen.

Another thing, I think I'm starting to hook onto. It's the concept that... When you spend your entire life in isolation, the stinky. It becomes... a skill in and of itself... It's... Just... You said the most meaningful part of coming here. And... Going to, uh, like a jazz gym or charity thing, is to learn how to conform. And not just how to do it, how to engage and disengage. In a healthy way. As I think about Starbucks, too, it's like... I think I had gone used to being engaged with the group there. Because all of them inspired me in some way. But now it's at a point where a lot of them make me feel negative. Okay. So learning how to detach from that... It is a, uh, incredibly valuable skill to have. But at the same time, running have you attached to... to the... Blake, jazz groups, and the running groups here, you know, how to just kind of fall in line with something. It's just as important as learning how to detach from. Something like Starbucks.

Also, one of the point I wanted to make is with the masturbation stuff. Good morning. Morning. When you start to remove the reward for the stimulus, I think that's what happens. where the flat barn comes from. Because I've noticed it today, but there's a lot of people. Especially runners, but... I'll be attracted too. But now, the reward for seeing more of them. Following them around has declined. I found myself more willing to let go. and see other opportunities. More plausible ones.","",0,false,Markdown
