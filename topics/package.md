# Business Plan

Intentions right now is to summarize whatever information i have on planning out the bootcamp.

## Niche

1. Who is the target audience?

- People around my age, 20-30 or so. 
- Listen to rock, punk, rnb
- Meditate or overall mindful
- Growth-obsessed
- Want to be able to play with friends
- Keep seeing Reels or TikToks that energize them to play
- Strong desire to learn music as a form of expression but parents limited them
    - Hidden resentment
- Charitable and want to pay forward to the music community
- Single or dual income, no kids at home
- Look for outside help when they want to accomplish goals
    - Process-oriented with goals
    - Beauty in the journey
- See music as a curiosity, another way to express themselves
- See this as an investment into themselves
- Supportive people.
- Probably Autistic? Something that gives them the urge to play the same things over and over again
- Good listeners

2. What is their subculture, role, or identity?

3. What problems do they face? (urgent, painful, expensive, annoying)

- Dont know how to hold the sticks
- Dont know how to setup or sit at a kit
- Dont know how to read music
- Too loud (annoying)
- Can be expensive
- Take up too much room
- Neighbors could get annoyed
- Perfectionism
- Lack of attention
- Joint pains and arthritis
- Dont feel like they have a voice in their day to day life
- Dont have the time to practice
- Dont know how to justify learning something without being the best at it
- Dont have music friends to play with
- Feel like they need permission to begin playing, someone to tell them that it doesn't matter how they set it up. "Having someone with knowledge tell me how to sit at a kit was all I needed to actually sit and play."
- People in life told them they weren't allowed to be creative, restricted their creative tendencies and made them feel ashamed of desiring them

4. What are their desires, dreams, and unspoken motivations?

- They get excited thinking about the fact that after this camp they will be able to continue learning on their own
- To be heard, valued, and seen in a way that their jobs or life dont currently permit
- Pure connection to the feeling and soul of music
- Thirst for Power and Control
- Dance-like element to it
- Exercise
- People want to fuck the drummer
- A creative outlet for extreme emotions, usually anger, sadness, betrayal, or even for excitement
- Be able to play along with their favorite songs, go through the motions
- Be able to talk to their friends about music on a deeper level
- Getting to be a part of drum circles
- Be able to play live music with their friends. Either gigs or jam sessions
- Be able to pick a part recordings to learn what to play
- Power of commanding a room, domineering, leading, influence
- Free themselves from a world where power was taken from them
- Permission to be themselves loudly

5. What language would they use to describe their situation?

## Irrestible Offer

1. What is their dream outcome?

2. What is their perceived likelihood of achievement?

3. How fast will they get the results?

4. How easy will it be to get the results they're looking for?

5. What are the bonuses, guarantees, scarcities, and urgencies?

6. How is the pricing determined?

--- 

Use the desirability of a drummer as a selling point. People WANT a drummer. People NEED a drummer.

What are the resistances for people who actually have never drummed? What are the problems I'm trying to solve?

Every post so far has reccomended a teacher. This is good for me. They also reccomend a couple of lessons, so I think somewhere between 6-8 weeks of lessons is the golden zone. That way it's enough to attract people in (get results fast) without being too large of a commitment.
