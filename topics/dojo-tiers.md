Nice — I dug into conservatory syllabi, drum-set curricula, Percussive Arts Society material, and pro session/gig guides and rewrote the belt requirements so they’re drummer-first and tightly focused on six categories you asked for: Time, Sound, Technique, Dynamics, Groove, Musicality. I used concrete, testable thresholds (tempos, rudiments, demo tasks, repertoire, session/gig targets) so each belt is objectively gradable and — by Black Belt — the player is legitimately ready for gigs, recording, and teaching.

Below are the results (with the most important research sources shown at the top). After the belt table I give assessment rules, sample test scripts, and quick implementation notes so you can drop this straight into your dojo grading system.

    Berklee Online — Drum Set Performance 101 (curriculum structure: musicianship, coordination, repertoire, ghost notes, style units). (Berklee Online)

    Percussive Arts Society (articles on feel, groove, dynamics, and practice approaches). (Percussive Arts Society)

    University drum-set (UNT / conservatory) curriculum examples (weekly assignments, ensemble expectations). (music.unt.edu)

OVERVIEW — HOW THIS WORKS

    6 Categories (tested every belt): Time, Sound, Technique, Dynamics, Groove, Musicality. Each requirement below lists what to demonstrate and a pass standard (often with tempo / duration / rubrics).

    Belt Levels: White → Yellow → Orange → Green → Blue → Purple → Brown → Red → Black (you can compress or rename later).

    Each belt requires a set of demos (video or live) and a portfolio item (recording clip, practice log, lesson plan for higher belts, gig/session evidence for upper belts).

    For fairness, use a 0–4 rubric per item (0 = not attempted, 4 = professional standard). To pass a belt, score at least 3in every category and no zeros in core categories (Time, Groove, Technique).

    Wherever metronome tempos are listed, test both with click and against a backing track.

Assessment: Rubrics & Tests (quick reference)

    Use a 0–4 rubric per tested item:

        4 = Professional standard (Black Belt level)

        3 = Consistently correct and musical (passes belt)

        2 = Needs improvement but functional in ensemble

        1 = Fragmented; inconsistent

        0 = Not attempted / failed

    Core categories (must be ≥3): Time, Groove, Technique.

    Portfolio evidence: recordings, gig invoices, session logs, lesson plans, student progress. All Brown+ students must maintain a portfolio folder (digital).

    External examiner: Brown→Black requires at least one external pro/educator juror signoff to reduce bias. (ABRSM/conservatory practice inspiration). (abrsm.org)

Sample test scripts (copy/paste into teacher portal)

    Time test (Blue belt): Play 8-bar groove at 100 bpm with metronome on subdivisions; after 3 bars, mute click for 8 bars, then unmute — stay within ±1.5 bpm. (Record single continuous take.)

    Sound test (Purple belt): Present three different tones (punchy pop, warm room, vintage muffled). For each tone: show tuning choices, muffling, and mic selection suggestion (short 30–60s clips).

    Technique test (Green belt): 12 rudiments at prescribed tempos; 4-limb coordination pattern for 16 bars including bass-snare independence.

    Groove test (Brown belt): Learn an assigned studio chart in one rehearsal (30 mins), then record the first complete take with correct fills and transitions.

    Musicality test (Black belt capstone): Produce a 3-song demo EP with documented production notes and at least one external producer reference.

Implementation notes & fast wins

    Video templates: create “what to record” templates per belt (keeps student submissions uniform).

    Quarterly grading events: run public belt tests with parents/bandmates present → better accountability.

    Session room: build an in-dojo room for mock sessions — crucial for Brown+ to log studio hours. (Gearspace)

    Partnerships: partner locally with a producer, venue, and school ensemble to accelerate gig & session opportunities (UNT-style curriculum partnerships). (music.unt.edu)

If you want, I’ll now:

    Turn this into a printable rubric sheet per belt (PDF); or

    Produce video test scripts (exact language & camera angles) for White→Blue first; or

    Create a student portfolio template (what files to keep and how to tag them).

Which one should I make next?


Great -- I dug into conservatory audition specs, Percussive Arts Society curricula, ABRSM's drum-kit grades, Berklee's drum set coursework, pro session guides, and studio prep checklists, and used those to **tighten and validate** the Dan system so every Dan has measurable, research-backed thresholds across your six categories: **Time, Sound, Technique, Dynamics, Groove, Musicality** -- plus clear, professional evidence (gigs, studio credits, teaching records). Below is the upgraded, research-grounded Dan syllabus and assessment plan.

I'll (1) summarize the research anchors so you see where requirements came from, (2) present each Dan level with _concrete, testable requirements_ for the six categories and professional milestones, and (3) give implementation notes (external validation, rubrics, evidence). I cite the heaviest sources after the key statements so you can follow up.

* * *

## Research anchors (why these requirements)

- University/percussion audition documents and conservatory curricula define what "performance-ready" means (repertoire volume, sight-reading, multi-style competency, and proof via auditions). These informed the repertoire, sight-reading, and ensemble standards. ([University of Redlands](https://www.redlands.edu/globalassets/admissions--aid/music-admissions/conservatory-of-music---percussion-audition-requirements.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Percussive Arts Society articles & PAS curriculum studies outline national percussion objectives and sequencing for drumset in academic programs -- used to validate progressive technical and ensemble milestones. ([Percussive Arts Society](https://pas.org/publication-articles/standards-based-curricula-in-applied-percussion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Berklee Online & Berklee course listings show typical college-level drum-set learning outcomes: coordination, feel, repertoire, Afro-Cuban and shuffle studies, and practical studio skills -- used to set tempo ranges, style list, and DAW familiarity. ([Berklee Online](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/drum-set-performance-101?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- ABRSM Drum Kit syllabus gives a graded framework for repertoire, technical tests and sight-reading which helped shape precise performance metrics. ([abrsm.org](https://www.abrsm.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/Performance%20Grades%20Qual%20Spec%20-%20Drum%20Kit%202024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Pro-session / studio checklists (Yamaha, studio blogs) provided the real-world studio and session expectations (prep, click use, ability to deliver takes, mic & take etiquette). ([Yamaha Music](https://hub.yamaha.com/drums/d-how-to/how-to-become-a-great-session-drummer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

# Upgraded DAN SYSTEM -- Drumset (research-backed, measurable)

General rules for grading all Dan levels:

- Use the six categories as **core rubrics**. Each item scored 0--4 (0 = not attempted, 4 = pro standard). Passing a Dan requires average ≥3.0 across all six categories and meeting **professional milestone** thresholds (gigs/studio/teaching) for that Dan.
- Evidence types: live audition, recorded demos (raw takes + stems), lesson plans & student progress, gig invoices, producer/venue references, external juror letter.
- Brown/Red/Black previously now map to Dan 1--3 for professional levels and Dan 4--5 for mastery/lineage.

## Assessment & Implementation (concrete next steps)

1. **Rubrics:** build 6-category rubrics (Time, Sound, Technique, Dynamics, Groove, Musicality) with 0--4 scales and explicit evidence prompts. Example for _Time_: 4 = ±0.5 bpm over 3 min + successful mute-click test; 3 = ±1.0 bpm; etc.

2. **External jurors:** require outside juror signoffs for Dan 2→3 and 3→4 promotions (conservatory/jury model). This prevents internal grade inflation. (ABRSM/conservatory practice.) ([abrsm.org](https://www.abrsm.org/sites/default/files/2024-04/Performance%20Grades%20Qual%20Spec%20-%20Drum%20Kit%202024.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

3. **Portfolio system:** digital student folders (stems, clips, gig invoices, lesson plans) -- required for Dan assessments.

4. **Partnerships:** form relationships with a local producer, venue(s), and at least one university percussion program for guest jurors and studio opportunities (based on PAS & Berklee industry integration models). ([Percussive Arts Society](https://pas.org/publication-articles/drumset-in-the-university-percussion-curriculum/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

5. **Mock sessions & audits:** create a staffed "session room" for in-house graded recording sessions (required evidence for Dan 1--3). Use studio checklist (prep, click, mic etiquette) for evaluation. ([Drum Audio Editing](https://www.drumaudioediting.com/post/6-step-pre-studio-checklist?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

6. **Continuing education:** require Dan holders to re-certify or present annual clinics to maintain standards. This preserves the dojo lineage and ensures ongoing relevance.
