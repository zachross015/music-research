Simple rules and their evolution: one of my favorite things to explore in life
is *the evolution of simple rules*. In biology, we have boids, in computer
science we have conway's game of life, in mathematics we have axioms. In all
cases, entire fields have been evolved from the structure of simple rules. In
music, I've found this same semblance in clave patterns. In reading about
Afro-Cuban rhythms, its become apparent that distinctive genres are always
spawned from siple rules. From the Bembe, we've evolved the Rumba, Son, and
Bombo clave patterns. Each one of which has distinctive rules no what
instruments to use, what rhythms to play, what dances and melodies/harmonies
are spawned on top of them, which scales to use, what ceremonies celebrate.
Each of them has an entire culture that has evolved from the creation of
rhythms displaced by one note (most important part). It makes me wonder, can we
spawn new genres by changing the rhythm? #blogs #ideas #exerpt
