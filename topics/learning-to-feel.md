[[Happiness Hypothesis]] talks about how most of our decision making
comes from emotions. That's why people with lobotomies don't make
decisions easily. This can be used to help with art by attuning
yourself to the emotion of a piece.  When you begin to truly *feel*
the art, you begin to make decisions which align with those emotions.
This is why every artist should go through a "calibration" period of
approaching other's art, understanding the language that others use
to communicate that emotion. Through that lenses, most of the
artistic decision making process comes from observing how emotions
are communicated under a certain context, learning how to recreate
those emotions through repetition, and finally allowing this
vocabulary to arise naturally in a creative context.  #blogposts
