Title: Productivity for Humans
Subtitle: 

I grew up in the exponential surge of technology starting in the early 2000's, raised by a combination of ADHD and OCD. This combination of factors left me obsessively inattentive, constantly craving attention and approval (include something earlier about being a first born), and having to learn new rules every year for how the world work due to the increasingly obsolescent technology. The way I'd been living before is a mystery to me, but I can only explain it as doing whatever I could to avoid pain. 
I started writing this book in 2025 at the age of 28. Or maybe really 10 years ago when I picked up the book "How to Read a Book." Everything outlined in this book is knowledge I've picked up over the course of at least 50 different self-help books taht have aided me in the path to where I'm on now. This the same path that took me from being a 25 year old Ph.D. Computer Science student working on the cutting edge of Ai, thinking about marriage, and about to buy a house to a 26 year old $10,000 in debt, heartbroken, in my parents basement, alcoholic, and starting a career in art. This kidn of transition is the perfect plot for any comedy, but it was a gut wrenching time in my life and i dont want to include that in the book but the transition if we can make it funnier would be great. The purpose of this book is to lay out the overarching themes of productivity I've come across from years of self-growth. In the crash that occured between 25-26, I found a new way of living. There was some simplicity, some beauty, in the grief that followed burning everything to the ground. Like a slash and burn policy put into effect, new seeds were set to grow. It was an awakening that shed light on the beauties of life. A morning with nothing to do, no technology. Sitting with my dog. Tea instead of coffee. Smelling the roses. And so from here, I set out to work ON my life instead of IN my life. 

What follows is a dump of all the most important concepts I've learn about growth. This is meant to be a reference more than anything. I'm hoping that by giving you these tactics, strategies, and tips that you too can slow down and embrace more of life.
