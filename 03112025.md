Apparently Gene Krupa was the first to include bass drum in the trap set on
record. That's kind of crazy.

Words of Louis Bellson

- Played alot of singles
- Had the incredible ability of playing the same lick every time, yet every time
  it got better and better
- Expressed insecurity about being able to play the chops that people liked
  Louis Bellson played, yet he could bring the house down with a simple beat and
  showmanship


The singles he did on sing sing sing is something I'm thinking about alot now.
That could be such a powerful lick if used intentionally. It's not even that
difficult, but it sounds so nice. Benny Goodman was apparently pretty tough on
drummers, very particular about who he played with. 

March 3, 1938: Gene Krupa leaves Benny Goodman's band and starts his own, which
is an instant hit. Part of his departure was because he felt like multiple
people deserved the spotlight. He didn't want to have the only spotlight. He
wanted to share it with other viruostic musicians. His ensemble was definitely
much more showy.

"Well uh, steady beat first and foremost but also a beat that pulsates. Now you
see father, I was trained to play dance drums. And even to this day in the
wildest solo that I could possibly perform, if I felt that the beat werent there
and people couldn't dance to it, I would feel that I were failing in the solo."
