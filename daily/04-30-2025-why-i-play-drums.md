I think in the explorations I've done today, I've realized that this bootcamp shouldn't just be a run-of-the-mill learn the technical side of music. It needs to be a much more emotional experience, with connection to something higher than ourselves. It should lead people to a place of community and belonging.

Like here is what ChatGPT came up with.

Awesome. A 12-week adult drum bootcamp is such a powerful idea‚Äîand if you're designing it to help people *feel* rhythm, *reclaim* creativity, and *embody* confidence, you‚Äôre not just teaching drums‚Äîyou‚Äôre giving people back a piece of themselves.

Here‚Äôs a way to structure your **12-week program**, blending **core drumming skills** with emotional and embodied elements that speak to the adult learner.

Okay now summary from the pages.

## Summary

Why do I love playing drums?

I love playing drums because theres some pure connection to the music. Like
melodic instruments are fun to listen to, but I've never known one of them to
make me want to move my body without a percussive element to it. The stomping
of the foot or the slapping of the side. Even in guitar, watching someone try
to mimic the percussiveness is admirable but it never fully recreates the sound
of the drumset the power of the kick beating through your chest. The intensity
that you can feel from a rock drummer or the delicacy that you can get from
jazz. The way that a funk drummer can make your head move. The cognitive
distortion you can experience when beats are shifted slightly out of place.
That feeling of someone playing slightly out of time but still in the pocket is
such an existential experience as if for a moment its causing your soul to
separate from your body. The fluidity of it is like getting to hear the music a
ballet or a tap dancer moves to.  i absolutely love drums everything about it
the way it feels to exert that energy i used to come home after a bad day or a
breakup and i didn't want to run i didn't want to cry all i wanted to do was
shit myself on the kit ecause i was playing so much all i wanted to do was play
some heavy fucking rock music or heavy metal and beat all my problems away when
i was bullied when i faced my insecurities all that melted away when Nightmare
came on and I could just move all my limbs as loud and as fast as i can because
it was the instrument of expression its the instrument for those of us that
dont have a voice or havent found it yet its the instrument where they have to
pa attention to you where if you decide youre done everyone will hear it is the
most iportant instrument its the one that you have control over its the one
thing that no one can take away from you you didnt have to be good at it you
just loved being able to sit behind the kit and hammer shit out you didnt even
care if you were good at it or not until recently you just loved playing you
always felt like pride was what drove you forward but pride and anger dont have
that power it was always love you always loved playing you loved the escape you
loved the challenge you loved asking yourself "can I go there" and not stopping
until you you loved the addiction you loved the pain of not being able to
figure it out you loved the experiementation you loved everything about the way
it allowed you express yourself because that was you in those few moments you
could speak your truth in those few moments the universe aligned in your favor
dad couldnt yell at you and mom couldnt bully or belittle you drumming was your
escape and you have the power to give that to someone else you have the power
to channel that expression to teach this skill its addicting its gratifying its
amazing when you get done with a show and they all tell you how good that show
was how your fills popped off but the best feelings dont come from the stage
they come from the conversations you get to have with your friends about music
its like this whole other world opens up this new understanding for whats
interesting whats fun this whole world of excellence its like anything that
expands your mind like running or meditation i love drum circles that feeling
of getting to sit around with a group of people and just jam i love every bit
of it

### Insecurities

Its not glamorous people usually forget about it and it makes me feel lonely up
there it can feel like a burden sometimes being in the back being expecteed to
be perfet and not being able to achieve it its hard watching everyones backs
and playing a show for people where maybe only one of them will pay attention
to you and genuinely that makes me sad looking out into a crowd or even looking
at bandmates and not a single one of them is paying attention to you because
all you are is their time keeper its a thnakless job most the time it makes me
sad to think about how sad i feel with the drums how insecure i feel and
underrepresented i want to cry about it because it almost seems like another
place where ive chosen the lonelest instrument the one that no one pays
attention to the instrument with walls theyve frustrated you youve felt
misunderstood as a drummer you have so many places in your life where you were
made to feel insecure behind the kit by the same bullies that you couldn't
stand up to and now that you have to confront that you have to recognize that
they've impacted your ability to play your ability to take risks your ability
to shine on the stage eeryone loves when you play but you still dont feel like
your'e good enough to belong there i

contributes to this long running narrative of why i cant
be enthusiastic about drums for others why i always have to fake compliments
maybe i dont understand why i love drums and that frustrates me because ive
committed the rest of my life to doing it but maybe the answer is simple maybe

i fail to
recognize how i could convince anyone else to want to play drums when i dont
even understand why i play them like ive never really observed that the
feelings i get from playing drums and even when i observe them i dont feel like
i can do a great job at communicating them other then just saying like it feels
powerful. I think the thing i have a hard part understanding isnt as much the
drum aspect of it as it is like why does anyone try to learn something new
without striving to be the best at it? I mean I guess i dont want to be the
best at running but i do want to run marathons and ultra marathons maybe its
not about being the best as much as the feelings it gives you and i think with
music thats a hard part for me to understand because ive never really lived a
life without music without art what other reasons are there really to study an
instrument i guess just to enjoy it i mean ive said some stuff here that
resonates

### Generosity

being a drummer means to be generous it means to be someone who gives gives
gives and never expects anything in return it gives you the power to control
how the song feels the tempo of it the way that each instrument is hit

I think as a result of all this, I truly believe that learning art is about channeling energy. It's about training our body to connect to a spiritual being and channeling that being. We all have this innate sense of rhythm. The purpose of practice is to refine our bodies to carry that energy as transparently as possible, and do so regardless of the tools.
