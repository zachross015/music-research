Alot of rambling today. Probably the most important realization is that a
6-week plan is optimal where each week is dedicated to one of the six topics
described in Benny Greb's book:

1. Technique
2. Groove
3. Sound
4. Time
5. Dynamics
6. Musicality

Making each one into these massive insight moments not just in music but in
life itself is what's really going to sell this. Plus, that's what I actually
enjoy. They need to be so nutrient rich that they feel worth so much more than
what they are paying for. like every lesson they should leave feeling like holy
shit my mind is numb. Every single lesson needs to feel like they're leaving
completely evolved from who they were the time before. The following days
should really explore these categories and how to teach them to a beginner.

The whole camp should be six weeks with a two week guarantee if they aren't
getting all they need out of it.

But a **REALLY** good idea that is also difficult for me is to reach out to
enough people who want to start playing drums and understand what it is they're
looking for. This should happen post launch to kind of test the whole thing.
