So the intention for this week: Write about a solid business plan for the
12-week bootcamp, and everything I know about drums/how to teach it.

## Niche

- 20-30
- Growth oriented, ideally obsessed
  - Meditators optionally
- Not looking to reinvent so much as be able to play with friends
  - See videos online from really good drummers
- They've always taken an interest in music but parents didn't support it or at least didn't invest in it, so now that they can finally afford it they want to invest time and money into it (the same way that I am investing in being a marathon runner without having done sports in school)
  - See themselves being able to play on big stages, even if not as a career
- No clue where to start
  - Too much ambiguity online and need structure to fast track growth
- Type to have coaching and surround themselves with a high quality inner circle
- Find beauty in the journey over destination
- Value a fixed ending/outcome track but are willing to invest indefinitely for quality

## Problems they face

- Too loud
- Not ergonomic in the house
- Too much room
- What's the point when they could learn a melodic instrument
- Neighbors might be annoyed

## Insights and questions.

- I learned drums because guitar wasn't an option. Why do other people pick up drums in the first place? Does anyone actually aspire to be a drummer?
- Drummers and bassists are the most valuable instrument due to scarcity. How can this be leveraged?
- The problems I notice with drums are my own insecurities with playing them. How can I internally resolve these things?
- What successful musicians started playing later in life?

## Important quote 

> this is actually a really deep insecurity in my mind i can see why teaching
> has never worked out before how the hell am i supposed to understand why
> anyone else would want to play drums when i didnt even want to play them when
> i was just kinda coerced into it thats a crazy realization...but like why
> would anyone venture out on their own to learn drums its not necessarily a
> virtuostic instrument its not even really glamorous its the behind the scenes
> instrument that holds down the fort its the instrument that is the most
> important yet no one pays attention to *how can i cater this to people when
> i hardly view it highly and see it as being so critical*

The more I hone in on the ideas here, the more I question why people pick up an
instrument. I think it would be good to find a list of successful people who
started playing music in their 20's. But more importantly, I think a big part
of this is learning to understand why anyone decides to make a change in their
later development. Why would someone all the sudden decide to pick up drums?
Like I think there's a layer of curiosity, trying new things and seeing how it
impacts your mind. Maybe that's all it has to be. But why else would they start
playing? I honestly have no idea.

## Musicians who started later

- Bill withers didn't start his recording career until 32. (Need to watch Still Bill). He actually kept working in the factory after the hit release of "Aint No Sunshine" since he considered music a fickle industry. Because he didn't leave the factory, the record company eventually presented him with a gold toilet seat.

- Leonard Cohen was in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and started when he was 32.
- Butch Vig produced Nirvana's album "Nevermind" at 36 and didn't start his own band until 40 [Source](https://aristake.com/older-musicians/)
- Dan Wilson wrote "Closing Time" at 37
