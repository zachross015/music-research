So the intention for this week: Write about a solid business plan for the
12-week bootcamp, and everything I know about drums/how to teach it.

## Niche

- 20-30
- Growth oriented, ideally obsessed
  - Meditators optionally
- Not looking to reinvent so much as be able to play with friends
  - See videos online from really good drummers
- They've always taken an interest in music but parents didn't support it or at least didn't invest in it, so now that they can finally afford it they want to invest time and money into it (the same way that I am investing in being a marathon runner without having done sports in school)
  - See themselves being able to play on big stages, even if not as a career
- No clue where to start
  - Too much ambiguity online and need structure to fast track growth
- Type to have coaching and surround themselves with a high quality inner circle
- Find beauty in the journey over destination
- Value a fixed ending/outcome track but are willing to invest indefinitely for quality

## Problems they face

- Too loud
- Not ergonomic in the house
- Too much room
- What's the point when they could learn a melodic instrument
- Neighbors might be annoyed

## Insights and questions.

- I learned drums because guitar wasn't an option. Why do other people pick up drums in the first place? Does anyone actually aspire to be a drummer?
- Drummers and bassists are the most valuable instrument due to scarcity. How can this be leveraged?
- The problems I notice with drums are my own insecurities with playing them. How can I internally resolve these things?

> would anyone venture out on their own to learn drums its not necessarily a
> virtuostic instrument its not even really glamorous its the behind the scenes
> instrument that holds down the fort its the instrument that is the most
