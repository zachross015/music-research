The one note between rumba and son clave patterns creates a genre difference.
It makes me wonder how much this connects to the axioms of math. Are all genres
derived from a single rhythm? Because Rumba, Son, and Bombo claves have all
spawned such different genres with such different instrumentation. They're all
explorations of an underlying pattern. This kind of revelation has made me
realize that most good drummers play a solo around a centralized rhythm or an
axiom. Its about going on a journey to discover this rhythm.

i feel like im finally starting to understand how this all pieces together and
to an extent I feel like this is my fault going in with a misunderstanding i
use to do this with math textbooks alot where it was like i went in not knowing
what i was getting into and at first would get frustrated without tryint to
undersatnd or get the bigger picture but its like when i come out to write
about it or teach about it it makes all of this so much easier to understand
maybe thats the teacher or maybe thats just me but i feel like i just dont pay
attention to what im reading ecause even in having the difficult converstaion
yesterday i feel like going back and reading how i couldve handled the
situation better makes the book actually beneficial like its not there for
understanding so much as reinforcement
