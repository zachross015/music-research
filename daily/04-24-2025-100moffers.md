An offer is a coating for an underlying package. It is a way of presenting to a unique niche a proposition that you may solve their problems for them. 

How can I disentangle the *value* of something from financial insecurity? Like in creating this offer, how can I focus on the underlying asset in a way that makes me indifferent to the financial outcome and instead approaches this as a genuine desire to help others grow and succeed? How can I see it less as a manipulative urge to coax money out of people and instead see it as a way to share a common joy and spread my love for drums? How can I create more content around this in a way that feels genuine?
