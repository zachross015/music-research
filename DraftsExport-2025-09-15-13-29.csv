Being around other people is just straight up better than being alone. When I settle into myself, I feel so relaxed around others. There's no pressure to be someone I'm not. I laugh more, smile more, experience more. And being around Evan as a business owner is making me be able to vision what life could look like as a business owner. How easy and fun it could be, and how much simpler life could be

It feels like the energy drain I used to have came from doing so much that I didn't want to do just to fit in. When I have the strength to be and stay as myself, I no longer feel drawn towards betraying myself and preserve so much more energy that way. Plus, I feel more joy around my company, and am able to feel a much deeper appreciation and love for the people. Not to mention a deeper feeling of attraction and connection to beauty

A lot of confidence is allowing myself to be too dumb to understand ""why"" something shouldn't work. Like not allowing comparative aspects (sexiness, beauty, intelligence, skill) to get in the way of progress (eg asking someone out, auditioning for a gig, etc)

The healthier I get and the more in shape/attractive I become, the more I see social growth results. It connects to the stuff in [[Influence]] because of the halo effect around attractiveness. Almost like my shape and condition is part of my social brand on this world. My appearance becomes part of the sale in a sense. Just trying to make sure I'm not using this in a manipulative way. But this includes a lot of how I take care of the world around me. Hygeine, cleanliness, appearance, apparel, diet, etc all contribute

How does physical appearance, diet, apparel, and other more surface level qualities that influence attraction connect to Buddhism? Sometimes I feel like eating healthier, staying in shape, taking care of my body is a confusing grey area for confidence. Like shouldn't I be growing confidence in spite of these things? Or is reducing suffering by being diligent in these qualities a big part of confidence and self-esteem? Because recently I've been seeing more like secular/social progress because of my progress on my confidence, resulting from higher diligence in things like diet, meditation, exercise, and alignment with the things and people I love. But as much as I feel this progress and deepening love for myself, it's hard not to get caught up in the attention I've been receiving for the increased levels of attraction resulting from this increased confidence and diligence. Almost like I'm afraid to have it since it's a lot of responsibility to I guess not abuse.

In short, the answer is to view physical evidence as temporary and see it more as a support for deeper refinement

I didn't nap after work or really get a chance to rest, hardly ate, didn't meditate, didn't work out, and played a bunch of video games. The crazy part is like...I realize now just how much my habits differs from this lifestyle. I hated it today, not being able to do anything. Like most days, I can sense this kinda fallout and recuperate, but today I kinda wanted to explore it. And like I'm glad I did, but man it kinda sucked ðŸ˜… like what I'm getting at is that it's weird this is where I started, ya know? Like when I began this journey, this is what life looked like. Sitting alone in the basement, unproductive practice, hardly any exercise or meditation, just playing video games and eating poorly. And like the past couple weeks have been pure diligence, so indulging mindlessness today just made me aware of how far I've come. And I'm really proud of that. I still practiced of course. My head also feels so clear right now, no doubt from meditation. I've been able to detach super easily and be present.

This whole mindset has given me a completely different perspective on drums. Like I was playing along to jam tracks earlier and it hit me that I'm just there to keep time. Or maybe moreso, the other day I was listening to myself play along to the track and got frustrated because I couldn't latch onto anything I was playing. There was no consistency in the groove, just random notes here and there. What hit me today was that I'm meant to keep time so often. It should be like 90% of what I'm doing even when jamming by myself. And to that end, fills or minor changes should be rooted in the groove. On top of that, changes in the groove itself should be done intentionally and simplistically. Like changing the groove by adding more notes, displacing, omitting, orchestrating, etc. all the elements of energy that are present in jazz are present in every genre, and it's about learning how those subtleties are communicated. That's what makes a great drummer","",0,false,Markdown
