The energy we bring is a gravitational field no different than the physics in astronomy. Repulsive people who seek to serve only themselves as as a magnetic repellant except to those who do the same. Attractive people make an impact on others not by controlling them, but by causing enough of an impact, having enough "mass" or *mattering enough*, that others fall into their orbit. We can learn alot from the movement of planets, because on a macroscopic scale, cahnge happens in thesame exact way. Things enter orbit, but the quantity of what eneters i directly proportional to how strong your pull already is.
