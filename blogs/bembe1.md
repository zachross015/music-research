## Intro

Every year I journey into a new genre of drumming as part of developing a synoptical knowledge of different genres. It's a little something I picked up from *How to Read a Book*. 

This year I wanted to cover Afro-Cuban drumming. 

Full disclosure: I started last year learning a bit about this stuff for three months. It was in the middle of a year learning about jazz though and while researching the genre, I'd realized three months was not nearly enough to get into as great of detail as I'd liked to explore. So entering into the New Year, I've made it a goal to familiarize myself with the genre, and bring you with me! 


## 1 No Met

One of the most important parts of Bembé or any kind of folkloric genre comes from the fact that there was no metronomes. Time relativity was based on knowing your space in a group. When other people were playing, it was about having enough space to have a certain amount of notes in between and knowing exactly where and when you fit. It was about respecting a kind of hierarchy that exists within the instruments. 

It reminded me of this concept in *The Music Lesson* where, when you listen to the chorus of creatures in the middle of the woods, none seem to talk over each other. Each animal, each plant, each bug, etc, all have their place both in time and wavelength. Their calls can create a unity which creates safety when in danger, or just to signal each other for mating. Even silence is played frequently when predators appear.

I think coming from a period where we've had metronomes for so long put me at a learning disadvantage because relaxing into the group dynamic went against every fiber of my being. Years of drum corp and sitting alone in a practice room do nothing when your time becomes relative to the company around you. It's not about playing precisely so much as it is understanding tendencies to move *with* time. 

## 2 Group Interplay

I've started thinking virtuosity came about when people started being able to survive as individuals. It's something I notice more and more. As I get older, I've noticed isolation get promoted to greater extents each year. This shift gets reflected in my playing too, where I've always felt there was a glamour in being an individual, having chops, and standing out.  This feeling made listening to this music at first feel foreign because I couldn't figure out where the solos were, which instrument held the melody, or even how to practice this on the drum set.

It may just be because I don't really know anything about the time period, but one of the most fascinating parts about listening to something like Bembé music, is that *no single person, no single part, stands out*.  The melody and the power of this song all come as a result of communal playing. No part takes the spotlight. And I think it makes sense. If that music is coming from a place where people had to rely on each other, where people lived in tribes, no person stood out as an individual. Everyone was part of a community and played a bigger role in the growth or survival of their community. 

I was so fixated on looking for a moving part that I missed the point of it entirely. That there is no moving parts, or they're scarce and sacred when they appear. The purpose of this music is to be a part of something. In the middle of it. And part of the foundation of it. And I think in starting to understand that better, I can take that everywhere I go. It's not just about playing well, but playing the part that is invisible, yet means the most. 

## Outro

I realize I still have a lot to learn.  There must be some kind of reason why, you know, people just starting to play in these ceremonies, we're always just given the cowbell roll, or the Benbe Bell roll.  And it's something I want to gain insight from.
