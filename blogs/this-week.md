The weight of groove has started sinking in. It doesn't feel any different from meditation in that the goal of it is to stay with the object of focus and letting go of distractions as they come and go. In the context of groove, it seems it's moreso about staying consistent with time, relaxing into it, and not explicitly reacting to others playing without intention. I think when coming from roc and metal, it's been hard to understand this concept since most the parts were so syncopated. That and the fact tha I've had such a technique focus has made me aware of how little I know how to use my chops effectively. I think I relied too much on them as a means of "storytelling," really trying to impress rather than trying to groove and enjoy. But this whole approach has made me see just how much more important it is to stick to the same part regardless of the changes going on around you, at least until fills and other supportive playing can be done intentionally 


With my revelation at the gig last week, I feel like part of the changes coming in (or at least that I need to make) are a deeper appreciation and experience of live experiences. Not just music, but being able to bypass the connection issues is going to make it so much easier to experience this, and I feel like the better I can feel this stuff live and around others the easier it's going to be to channel that into everything else I make. But this whole color pallet feels like a great first look into that, into being able to convey a feeling or experience to someone else

It feels effortless getting lost in something good, I'd like that to apply without the criticality, and I feel like that is the only thing that truly disintegrates my absorption.

> It feels way too simple to say that showing up is enough. It feels too simple to say putting up posters is enough. That talking to someone is enough. That my playing is enough. That I am enough.
> But what if that is all it takes? Is it possible that just surrounding yourself with opportunity is enough to be a part of it? That maybe the best people come into your life easily and stay? That the best musicians are made as a team?
> Am I willing to give up the idea that this has to be hard? Am I willing to put my faith into God that, so long as I show up, I will be guided through the rest? 

I came across this thought in my journal on January 21, 2026 as part of an ongoing revelation on the ways my struggles are self-induced. Since middle school, I've held onto multiple addictions (including sugar, video games, and social media) which have made connection feel performative at best. The further I delve into Music, the less distance I see between my connection to Her and my connection to the people around me. 

I decided at the turn of the New Year to quit them all cold turkey, and am proud to say I've just passed the one month mark on all of them. Although I still face withdrawls and grief from time to time, I see these as challenges which require creative solutions. "Weightlifting" reps in the form of social interactions and intentional relaxation. Going to new clubs, jazz jams, etc. From doing this, there's a greater appreciation for presence, a better connection with those around me. I think it's the disconnection from social media that forced be to seek connection elsewhere. It's made my relationships feel more *real* and less comparative. If nothing else, my self-esteem has shot up greatly. So much so, that after two years of deliberation, I finally played my first Jazz Jam. I was terrified, but it had to be done.

This quote resonated alot with me because it *is* the simple things that grow you the most. The past two years of my drum practice were self-motivated and directed towards goals that I had no feedback for. While I did grow quite a bit, going out of my comfort zone to play my first jazz jam provided me with more real world experience, feedback, and connection than 1000 hours alone in a basement ever could. These were the lessons from this:
- We can't create time. We can only serve it. There's a shared sense of time when we play together, and among professionals that pocket is massive. 
- Playing *with* the song (as opposed to on top of it) is a matter of letting go of the need to micromanage your own part. You get in groove by listening.
- You have to *earn* your fills.
- Listening can become a form of meditation if you allow it.

I want to end with a quote from Stephen Pressfield's *Turning Pro*.
> In a way I was lucky that I experienced failure for so many years. Because there were no conventional rewards, I was forced to ask myself, Why am I doing this? Am I crazy? All my friends are making money and settling down and living normal lives. What the hell am I doing? Am I nuts? What’s wrong with me?  In the end I answered the question by realizing that I had no choice. I couldn’t do anything else. When I tried, I got so depressed I couldn’t stand it. So when I wrote yet another novel or screenplay that I couldn’t sell, I had no choice but to write another after that. The truth was, I was enjoying myself. Maybe nobody else liked the stuff I was doing, but I did. I was learning. I was getting better.  The work became, in its own demented way, a practice. It sustained me, and it sustains me still.

Happy drumming!
