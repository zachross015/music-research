getting better at learning how this bell pattern incorporates to the rhythms of the world and also to the consistency of like the ceremonies and how they're developed to help me in my own life to understand how to build a more consistent structure that I could rely on

## Nature



Also have been noticing that being that anchor, the heavy groove, comes from feeling it no matter what. Being steady enough that people feel they can play anything with you there. Was thinking about this a lot when hearing the drum solo to Gravity with Larnell Lewis. I love his part But I thought so much more about the bass and piano parts, which stayed stable no matter what he played and let him bend in and out of time around them. It's made me think about how embarrassing it would be to be able to solo, but not play that stable anchor part that those two played. I think getting in groove is really being able to hear others parts without letting it phase you. It's made me want to practice more of this feeling, remaining unchanged even when everything around you changes. Good way to practice this would just be clapping along to either the quarter pulse or the fundamental rhythm and hold h that the whole song

This week, I asked myself one question repeatedly:

> How do I get more in groove?

Here are the answers I heard.

1. Don't *fill* until you can without losing the groove.
2. Know the literature (shoutout Seth Godin)
3. Play the rests with as much force as the notes. True in music and in life, know when to take a break.
4. Find more ways to listen to Music. When you've run out of records, try listening to the songs nature sings.
5. The smallest, unchanging roles are often the most structurally important.
6. Be an anchor. When you leave the groove, you violate Music's trust in you. Your playing is then tantamount to a gust of wind blowing over a cardboard cutout.
7. Make the audience part of the performance. It's through cooperation we thrive.
8. If you aren't grooving with the music, check the rest of your life. You might just be drowning.
9. You can't create time. You can only flow with it. Be the instrument that Music herself channels through. 
10. Don't try. Just do.
