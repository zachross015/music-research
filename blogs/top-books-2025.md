I want the tone of these pages to be more like, this is what these books will do for you. Not necessarily like this is what they did do, but some middle line between reccomendation/review.

Like I think I want it to be letters to a younger self of how these books impacted me. Or how any decision did.

Hey you,

We read alot of books in 2025. But among the piles of horse shit an dglorified blog posts spewed out by every other youtuber and "book" writer on the market, these were the ones that caused an impact. (phrase more nicely)
Going into this year, your biggest goal was social growth. This book set the stage for all that was to come of it. 

# Never Eat Alone

Keith Ferrazi laid out the path to being a superconnector, someone who is capable of bringing about opportunities by placing yourself in the center of many networks. In reading this book, you realized the importance of connection in having an impact. You'd once believed it possible to amount to great things alone, but this book shed a light on the power of working with others whilst paving a roadmap to get there. It was an enlightening read. It laid out a great many habits which challenged your beliefs on accomplishment and the role that others played. It opened your eyes to tactics which would help you connect broader and deeper with everyone in your life. It gave you a greater sense of gratitude for those in your life. 

Among the many tactics, you'd gained the following perspectives:
1. you stand out by personalizing experiences when everyone else acts out of convenience,
2. connecting one person to another takes less than a minute,
3. the principles of *How to Win Friend's and Influence People* are simple but scarce,
4. social media can't replace real life connections, and 
5. plan your connections like your goals. 

# Supercommunicators

Charles Dhigu (check name) is masterful at laying out what it means to connect deeply with someone. You'd not heard much of this book prior to reading it, but it was inspirational to say the least. Among the intentionality you'd been adapting, it gave you a whole new approach to connecting with people on a much more vulnerable level. It helped you see past surface level differences in things like political beliefs and instead venture into much deeper, more emotional and identity-based, conversations which enhanced all of your relationships. This book may have had the most subtle, but game-changing impact of all the books you'd read. 

# The War of Art

This book became your bible. Written by an ex-marine, Stephen Pressfield defined for you all the battles you'd struggled to name. Since you'd read *How to Read a Book*, you'd been a big fan of synoptic connections between seemingly unrelated subjects. This book acted as the connection between battlefields and Art.

It's a book you still turn back to or reflect on everyday. But among all the tenets of Resistance, you'd recognized the most common one present in your life being a search for drama. A desire to know of and participate in it. Relieving your life of drama became a core practice and, while emotionally devastating, cleared your concious for greater growth. Doing so added a greater level of clarity to your life and made more room for honest people who shared aspirations.

# E-Myth Revisited

# Existential Kink

# The Practice

Seth Godin is a masterful sadist. Reading this book was one of the most painful experiences you've ever put yourself through, with each line tearing new holes in your line of reasoning deeper than the last. But, you couldn't put it down. Each paragraph, each sentence, and each word captivated you. You knew every word he spoke was true. You'd read This is Marketing, and immediately after purchased Tribes, Linchpin, and The gap one. 

Whether or net he'd intended to do so, Seth created a book which spoke to the same metaphyisical and spiritual properties that books like The War of Art and The Artist's Way did. The difference in his writing was that it spoke from a place of marketing. You'd hoped with reading E-Myth that (emy th author) was in some way wrong. That he was an older soul who knew nothing of art, nothing of change, either than the pursuit of more money. In all of the business books you'd read (eg Million Dollar Weekend and $100m Offers) you'd held onto a shred of hope that what they spoke of didn't apply to you. *The Practice* disembowled you. Yet, you're grateful to him for doing so.

Within the book, you've learned the power of Practice. The power of consistency. The power of change. The trust that comes from knowing who you are serving and doing everything in your ability to create the change they want to see. The most difficult pill to swallow was that you have any faculty, any control over your life. You'd lived for so long at the whim of others that this book gave you the choice to take control.

You'd hoped up until this point that when you wrote music, when you'd built a community, or when you ran that marathon that you could do so alone and others would follow. That in some sense, you'd never have to do the social work required to grow further. You'd never have to plan anything. Opportunities would come to you and you could continue living a vagabond lifestyle where everyone conspired to build you up without ever having to plan or do much to give back. The whiplash of this book sent you spiraling for weeks, but you're better because of it.

On the other side of it, you changed your approach. Goals stopped being "make $1m" and instead became "help 40 people." You grew to like the structure of consistency, planning out practices more dilligently and with greater intention. You stopped video gaming. You cut out social media. Your connections began flourishing, and you finally had time to practice more, run more, and be a better friend.
