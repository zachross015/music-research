- central space that has all the tools to teach lessons
- Rent out a room for lessons period, part of the payment goes towards the studio (automatic and online)
	- Have musicians sign up?
- Musicians can pay for credits that teach them marketing and sales skills and leadership skills

Like...increasing it. Sometimes to incredibly high levels. I saw this woman in the lobby of Starbucks, nothing special about her. She was blonde and  wore a black hoodie and Lululemon leggings with black Hokas. I couldn't take my eyes off her. And the whole time, there was this strong desire to do something about it. To masturbate. To store it for later so I had something to think about when I got home. 

It's made me think a lot about the world I've missed out on by being so addicted. I've seen it as so normal, as a way of relieving stress or getting ready for bed or even just an escape for spiritual fantasies in things I feel unfilfilled by. In changing that, I feel like I'm about to experience love, especially sexual intimacy, as something that *doesn't have to be dealt with* and can just exist. At least, I'm hoping for that. And I'm hoping it changes my relationship with people, from looking for things to put into the spank bank to cultivating real intimacy, and also to stop being afraid of the intimacy I have with my family.","",0,false,Markdown

It was weird hanging with family last night and realizing how attached to phones we've become. I didn't know how to socialize with anyone, having been so reliant on my phone to fill the gap. And I watched everyone laser focused on the games on their phones instead of talking. Especially the kids. 

The process of growth always seems to feel in a way like detachment. Like at first, it's an attempt to separate yourself from those around you. Sometimes it takes an ego trick, like attempting to feel superior to them by treating yourself or your objectives as better, to kickstart it all. Like I begin now to really see how disorganized my mom is, or scared my dad is. Not in a like negative or resentful way, but in the sense that I know where I got those things from. Growing up here means distancing myself from those habits and allowing those to be a part of who I am publicly.

Why do I want so badly for her to agree with me?

Because I need to be right. Because I want to fuck her so I need to say whatever it takes to win her over. Because if she doesn't agree with me then I'm invalid. Because if she, a beautiful women, doesn't validate me then no women will. **Because she mirrors my younger self and I'm trying to explain to her what I would've told myself, and I'm frustrated that I can't get through to her.** I'm fucking frustrated that I can't stop her from going the same way I did. From following the life that someone else set out for her. From being deluded into thinking money is everything. Money can't solve your heartbreak. Money won't stop a bear from attacking you. More money can't fix the pain you feel. You're a selfish fucking prick and the world will show that to you one way or another. 

It still doesn't fully explain the insecurity I feel.

I think it's like...if I can't prove to a 19 year old that I'm sure of what I'm doing, then am I doing the right thing? Resistance I believe. Idk. An 8 year old would think it's cool. An 80 year old would think it's brave. I think it's like that fear of going to the gym In a way. Someone who actually goes to the gym would cheer you on. You're only judged by the people who do nothing. She complains about the cold in 60 degree weather. So why should I care what she thinks? If she wants to complain about her feet hurting at Starbucks then let her. 

I think part of it is it feels like she's trying to control my beliefs. I defy the paradigm in her world of what it means to be successful and be happy, and I think it makes her uncomfortable. It feels like she's trying to put her beliefs onto me and i don't like being controlled that way. It feels like she's ""trying to understand"" but really just trying to convince and I hate that. Or maybe that's what I'm doing. I think I want her to like me, and for some reason it feels like the disagreement gets in the way. 

It feels frustrating and I'm holding onto it for whatever reason. 

It's like I need her to believe me. Or I need everyone to believe me. To believe in me. To understand me. Because then I don't have to deal with my own insecurities. Like I can stop them from running into the thorns by telling everyone to stop instead of removing the thorn. 

I want to let this go.

I think what I feel is guilt. For who I was when I was her age, and how I pushed so many people away by trying to convince them to be a part of my model. And I'm trying to save her from that as a way of fixing what happened to me. Because the loneliness I experience now has a lot to do with the way I treated people then.","",0,false,Markdown

Simultaneously, I've begun realizing that I can't change the world, but the energy I carry changes everyone around me. My mental health practices have begun to extend beyond myself and into the people around me, and the more I commit to being the truest and best version of myself, the more joy I and the people around me experience. I become an authority by committing to my values and allowing others to participate in the joy I experience because of it.
