## Goals

No goals were established for the week. No weekly review was done. Mainly due to the depth of attachment issues discovered from the week before. 

## Summary

- The sadistic brat began to come out more and more in the beginning of the week after last week's revelations, seeing most of our dynamic as a power trip and trying to convince myself that she has feelings for me outside the dynamic.
	- "The sadistic brat was talking about how naughty she was, seeing her as having done this for attention, and I'm drawn to it. Sexually energized by it. Like I'm leaving work so fucking horny from the withdrawal."
	- "It's not just in the bed room I want to play with her, but
	  her mind is what I want to toy with."
- It all comes from a lifetime of being forced into a person that I'm not. My perception of love is surrounded by shame in being who I wished I could be on both sides of the aisle, so it makes sense that my relationships are fueled with causing shame over love, forcing round pegs into square holes, and punishing for short comings.
- "You'll likely find that you were used before you ever used anyone." - ChatGPT
- Found out she actually was dating the new guy and it sent me in a tail spin
- My desires have changed immensly from when I started this journey. I had a SOC talk with God on what I was asking for in a relationship, and it was all much deeper than when I asked the first time. Much more wholesome, loving, and based on feeling rather than looks.
- This is when I started to discover the attachment narrative: killed at birth
- Experienced somatic trauma shakes for the first time ever after reliving my first death, debilitated me for an entire day
- Sado-masochistic urges may come from two things
	1. Innate anger from being torn away at birth
	2. Only being able to communicate emotion in my family by manipulating others into feeling the same thing
- Began to notice more ways I was being manipulative
	= posting on insta to make her jealous
	- going places and talking about them to make her jealous
	- convincing her the guys she's with is an asshole
	- neglecting our friendship 
	- bailing on hang outs
- Began to notice how bad of a friend-leader i was by not being transparent about how I felt about people in general, hiding feelings constantly out of fear of rejection which just ended up creating internal pain and jealousy
- Brandi "dating" this guy ended up being a loaded issues with roots in
	- Insecurity with my own career and fear there's no love on this path
	- Obsession caused by feeling heard for the pain and feelings I was experiencing, partially because I had created too small of a container for them to exist in (ie no one knows I like Brandi)
	- 
- Had my first gig where I requested to be paid. I felt for the first time this week that I valued myself, that I now had gigs and lessons as self-created income streams: self-created value, and that this was the beginning of bearing fruit.
- Had my first experience asking a bunch of people around town for help when I lost my beater (instead of buying a new one) and was rewarded with help from Steven
- Started seeing how much and how often I give ALL of myself up for someone else, so all my relationships have been built on this, mostly because to me detachment=death so preventing detachment=living, which consequently has made regulation impossible and all my breakups into identity crisises
- Saw ways my manipulative tendencies became projections. She's a pure-ish person and the ways I've manipulated her have tainted my perspective
- Felt guilt everytime I had the urge to manipulate her after this

## Good Things

- Began to decouple sado-masochism and witness it rather than indulge
- Took first real steps to moving past attachment issues, despite their pain
- Valued myself for the first time and began to see how addictive it feels to *create* value.

## Problems

- I think I got 3 hours of dilligent practice total
- Obsession, attachment issues, and identity displacement caused me to frequently disregard myself, my dog, and my family. There was 2 meditations, almost no goo meal prep, 2 days of dilligent exericse, and a massive addiction to video games
- All of the focus was on her this week. I lost myself completely. It was almost like my entire focus was on retaining her. This brought out so many attachment issues. 
- Masturbating to the sadistic things didnt actually help. It really just hurt. Only when I did it from a consensual place did it feel good.
- Masturbation addiction
- Ate like shit
- Even during dilligent practices, had absolutely no focus on what I was doing
- Almost no progress on website, which is needed to launch career forward
- No tiktoks, blog post, or newsletter like I had hoped to complete

## The Overall Issue

The overall issue was rooted in attachment issues. Despite all the pain and suffering I endured this week, I think I actually made alot of progress on identifying the issues. There was alot of deep digging and somatic release. There was much more perspective than ever before. I have begun to realize that the killed-at-birth narrative has deeply impacted all of my relationships and probably affects emotional regulation to an extent, having been forced into so many places where I didn't feel like I belonged made it hard for me to connect and taught me that love comes from an authority telling you "I love you so you have to do this," the persistent pain and suffocation I felt in relationships manifested as pain which I used as "love" for my partners, and the KAB narrative has caused me to view detachment as a form of death which has made me frequently give up all parts of my identity to keep attachments alive. That last one is the most important part and the solution: stop giving yourself up for others.

## Solution

No more giving yourself up. There are plenty of ways to be loving and express yourself without losing yourself in the other person.
