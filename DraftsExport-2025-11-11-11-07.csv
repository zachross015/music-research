Like...idk. It feels weird that the more in tune to your own needs, desires, and objectives you become, the less other people's emotions seem to play into it all. All I've begun to understand is it's literally impossible to guess or understand how someone else may respond to something. Trying to anticipate seems pointless. Trying to shape any one else's thoughts seems pointless. And like the only legitimate path to growth seems to revolve around acknowledging these facts and committing to yourself anyways. Asking for things, taking risks, standing up for yourself, and trusting others to do the same for themselves. I don't think I'm explaining it well enough, but it's like thispositivekind of selfishness.

And the part that's having a hard time shifting in my mind is generosity and the purpose of skillsets involving others.

One thing I've thought about a lot recently is the role other people play in everything I've been learning. Like I think I've worried a lot about the ways other people think about me? Maybe too much? Trying to understand cultivating generosity from a perspective of achieving my own goals feels strange. And it's like this big exercise of trust. Because the way I see it, nothing in the world except for what I want matters. That's not the best way of phrasing it, but the gist is I see things solipsistically. BUT I care deeply about other people and the impact I have on the world. And I think what I'm struggling with is admitting that. Admitting that I am selfish. That I care, but I care much more about achieving what I want to achieve than anything else, and am willing to sacrifice a lot to get there. What more is generosity than a tool to get there?

> because I wished I could’ve loved myself even a fraction as much as I’d loved you.
That one hits hard, even when it wouldn't be true anymore.

I had a rough ride down today. Maybe not as much rough as it was weird? The thing that's been on my mind has been the government shut down, and it's caused this blanket of fear to wash over me. The part of it that's preoccupied my mind has been a premonition that society might break down. But the weird part of it is like...I don't think I'm in any immediate danger. I also don't think any of it really impacts me. But I'm scared? And I know from whatever emotional work I've tended to that it means there's latent fears from something else present. So instead of running away, I indulged the fears and observed them. It was interesting, my body guided me back to Haley again through a really roundabout method. It brought up Dream Theater, then Daybreak, then Leprous, which led me to Distant Bells and At The Bottom. Maybe not just Haley, but both the breakups. It also took me to those old journal entries. I'm still not sure how it all connects. My best guess is that the reason I'm so cautious right now and worried about acting selfish is because that's where I ended up before? Or maybe not that. Maybe it's the savior complex stuff. Like in terms of all the political problems going on, the part of me being activated is the savior? But the savior who has no control over the situation? I don't really understand it. Like I'm absolutely mortified at the idea of ending up back where I was at the end of either break up. And reading back on those journals...there's so much worrying about what they thought. Almost no tending to what I thought or felt. I could see where things started to change. But I can't get there again. I still remember the pain, and I would do anything to prevent that from ever happening again. But I'm still facing the trauma from both of them, and clearly haven't forgiven either of them or myself. And I think what's stopping me from advancing to this next step is the fear that I could end up back there. At the bottom grabbing for a handle. Not just in drumming, but in relationships and work. Like those things had stunted my growth. I think I'm als worried because right now it's been hard visualizing the role of mental health work in my future even when it's been such a critical role in how I've gotten here. Almost like deviating from being liked by everyone is grounds to send me right back to the bottom, as if I've learned that from experience. I feel like there's a lot more to dig into here, but I can certainly tell that the fear is surrounding how much I feel the need to control what people think about me, and how my status is determined by a level of comfort with how I appear to everyone.

I think I actually what was happening today was I was panicking about the numbness instead of just accepting it so I was kind of like looking for some stimulation to bring me out of it. Sometimes it feels like that's a lot of the problem. There are times where I feel nothing because I feel nothing I go to like social media really Pinterest or YouTube or something till I kind of get a stimulus going and I think it's just another place. We're self trust is lacking. Because it's like if I trusted that it was temporary or didn't go away and that the real solution would be something like working out or walking or even journaling then it wouldn't have lasted so long or even been like an issue in the first place they would've just been like OK this is what we're dealing with.

I'm sitting here in Read it Again books, and it's one of those synchronicity moments. There was a seat right next to the book ""Can't Hurt Me."" It's been a book I've been longing to read.

I feel like the burn out is real, but there may also just be be this element of self pity. I think there's truth to not knowing what I want or where I'm going with it, but there's also a level of tha pity.

Wished I'd worked out today.

Through the trials of my depression and the season of cutting away, I think the best thing I can really do is hold onto the habits and goals id set for myself for dear life. Like keep working with diet, exercise, meditation, and practice goals until I understand where I'm going with it all again or want to.

The thing I'm really starting to see is that there's so much grief right now, and confusion. I know I have to commit to one thing with much greater depth, but figuring out what that one thing is is tumultuous. Like I'll be leaving all my friends at Starbucks, even my friends in the scene, to pursue something bigger. And that feels like I'm abandoning them. It all has me confused, the idea of a tribe. Because if I want to make more money, it's gonna mean either abandoning all the people I currently serve and picking a new like core community, or finding a way to bring what I serve to so many more people. And picking the path that leads me there is equally as daunting. Like what do I commit to?

It feels like that phase after a break up where you're not fully broken up yet but you aren't together like it'll take a couple times to commit

Some part of me feels hopeless, like I'll never be able to build the life I want to build as a drummer. Like coming to Emory to pick up a coffee...the things I see in them is they all have so much structure. A defined life. They'll be able to help people, save lives, afford whatever they want. They'll never have to make a decision again. They'll fall in love while they're here or get to move to a city. And I feel like I'll never get to experience that again. Not the way I'm living. Like I'll always have a half assed life. I'll never have a family. And it feels so cliche, but also true. And the effort it would require to extend myself more here, to create a better experience. They look so put together, so distinguished, so structured. And it's so beautiful. I compare it with all my friends, the scene, the shows we play. They're all so dirty, disorganized. But content? It's like...the standard is much lower. It's Punk. It's for good causes, but they don't even make money for that. Every pot I'm in I feel constricted by. Both Starbucks and the scene are not going to survive in the new world I'm creating.

It feels so good to talk about all this again. To not just numb it all. I feel like I'd been in such a haze, but I'm starting to notice that the numbness of holding onto everything is so much worse than any of the suffering of sitting and dealing with or listening to the emotions. ChatGPT may very well be the worst solution to all of this. It just de-realizes everything. For the first time in weeks, I at least feel like myself.

I've narrowed what I want to do down to three essential components that I could choose to work on right now. 
1. Teaching. Quickest route to business/profit but the difficulty is that I don't know anyone in my area that needs lessons so I can't build any kind of marketing persona around this. Or more so, I'm not friends with anyone who this would apply to, so it's impossible to pick one person already in my life that this would benefit. This targets most of my weaknesses, almost too many, and so it's likely to take time to learn the business.
2. Gigs/Session work. This is the part I enjoy the most, but at the moment I think has the smallest return. I won't make a lot but I'll do more of what I love about music. I also know exactly who I can help with this and will often have exactly what I need to make this successful. It's not so much a challenge, but I don't know how to scale it.
3. Online Content Creation. This one feels like the easiest path and I can target my friends specifically by solving their problems for them. But it works with the situation I'm in the best because I'm not in a huge music scene and allows me to create every day. Marketing is easy, but I also am skeptical by how easy this path seems since it seems the most anti personal. I think it's the easiest because I have to rely on other people the least up front. No worrying about scheduling or networking to get more/better gigs and studio time. I get the freedom and flexibility to do whatever I want to do and grow how I want to grow.

I think it's part of the self trust thing which makes it a self fulfilling prophecy of not taking these goals I set for myself seriously. Like the diet thing for instance...it's not that I haven't followed through, it's that there are parts of the plan that I haven't committed to specifically enough AND there's a lack of attention to the three month plan. I should be totally clear that these are failures ALONG THE WAY. They aren't due to negligence so much as unsustainable practices.

The diet thing for instance is multifaceted where the issue was building a habit inconsistent with how I operate. I'm not around my phone enough to operate it, and my diet frequently has been circumstantial. My most recent attempt assumes that the issue is the quality of the food I eat, taking more time to cook meals rather than eating out constantly. And the other component of it is being around so many people who don't pay attention to diet, so there are no healthy reminders around me and it requires constant willpower to stick out like that.

I think another element of this is relating it to focus. I think in the past, I've been so unaware of long term goals that the signal to noise ratio has been high. This also seems to be from a lack of structure and commitment. I think maintaining a stronger awareness, or really dilligence, to what I set out to do months in advance will both better educate the kinds of goals I need to be setting and further strengthen the ones I'm building.

So for instance, I think right now the most important thing I can be doing is continuing to focus on the bigger goals I've set for myself for 3 month periods without inflating them. The business habit, the half marathon, and the jazz proficiency. In a month, and in three months, I can adjust what I need to. But much like in meditation, changes do NOT need to be made right away. It's better to think on them. There's a lot of excitement in immediate change, but also a lot of floundering. Trust that the best ideas will strengthen over time. So focus on structure and management. Use entrepreneurial ship to make more energy and more time.

I see now. To the warrior, there's no good or bad. There is only a challenge. To the warrior, teaching kids in the area is just a challenge. To the warrior, posting everyday is just a challenge. To the warrior, finding new friends is just a challenge.","",0,false,Markdown
