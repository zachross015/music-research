Getting students is still my #1 problem right now, so that needs to be the priority. Flirting with how I can build financial models though to save more money, eg the **cost** of loans via future contracts versus saving (ie the premium). Well and now I'm also thinking about all this debt I have to pay off. Wouldn't it make more sense, instead of paying the monthly amount, to get delayed interest credits, pay the monthly minimum payment, save the rest of it in an account with a guaranteed rate, then at the last minute liquidate and cover costs?","",0,false,Markdown

I feel better now but I also feel like there was a lot uncovered in this last rant that I don't quite know how to deal with. Like all the stuff with mom and dad. I feel like that's the truth of the disconnect I have with them. But idk. I'm also bored and stuck on this plane so it feels like emotional work is much better than anything else. If nothing else, it's the two parts are blame and resentment towards my parents, of which I feel deep shame for having in the first place (but don't deny existence of), and feeling shame for being a drummer--akin to the shame of someone coming out of the closet or telling the truth after lying for so long? The parents one especially hurts. There's also the layered cynicism which ironically I think comes from
My mom. I feel like there's some kinda pleasure thing involved in all this too. I mean even off the bat, the joy of putting the blame on them is that I don't have to take responsibility for my own failures in money and relationships. I get a scape goat, an easy pass. I get to stay small and let them do all the work for me. And when shit gets bad, I get to keep blaming them for my failures. Like every time drum stuff falls, I get to point at them and say if you hadn't fucked me up so much then I'd be successful by now. If you hadn't taught me to manipulate, I'd still have Jess. If you'd taught me how to socialize, I'd have had more friends. I could've been content to a simpler life if it wasn't for you. It makes me sick thinking this way. Gut literally feels bad and my eyes are watering. But it's true. Every time I fail I blame the two of you. I look even at my career of being a musician as a middle finger to you guys. This big reward that is evidence of your failures. Something you have to tell everyone about. I hope it brings you as much shame as it brings me. I hope you're as hesitant as I am to talk about it. I like the idea that you have to watch me fall, over and over. That I'm doing all this for your attention, affirmation, just fucking something. I'm doing this because I want you two to take control of me. To slap me awake. To come in and fucking take control. To tell me what to do. To take away my autonomy and my freedom again. I don't want it. All I want is for you to tell me what to do. But all this career is is revenge for all the ways you messed me up. All the trauma you gave me. I hope you find this all out one day so I can stop hiding just how much I fucking resent the both of you. I hate your smugness. I hate how little you care. How hands off you are. All I ever had was guard rails.

Writing all that out, the shame around drumming makes sense. Like building a career out of it. It's like...idk. It seems like the shame comes from blaming them. For not taking responsibility for my own growth. Kinda passively doing it and hoping someone else takes the wheel. For seeing all my shortcomings as their failures. For seeing myself as being behind and incompetent and worthless. I blame them, or at least my dad, for all those things, and I think the connection to drums is all rooted in the way dad had tried to keep me silenced in reactive rage. Not really forgiving them? Idk. I'm having a hard time articulating. 

I guess it's like the shame comes from the fact that I'm using this career as leverage? Like building it out of spite? For attention in a way. Like I only feel motivated to grow it when I think I'm losing their attention. There's this part of me that's completely spite driven here and I see it so clearly, almost like the career is tethered by the part that's attached to it. Like I WANT to fail here. To continue spiting them for all that I blame them for. To keep hurting them in a lot of ways. Instead of making any genuine attempts to grow, I constantly sabotage in order to stay small and make them conscious of their failures. Make them admit to them. Until one day one of them finally admits that they messed me up. That they hurt me. They failed me as parents. That one hurts to write. I hate this blame. This shame. It hurts a lot. I feel so burdened by it. But in existential kink fashion, I think I have to also admit that I love it. I love holding it over them. I find pleasure in that sadistic play of ""how long can you watch me burn."" How long does it take until you finally intervene and for once in my life give a shit about me dad? All I want is to get even so you have to feel the pains I felt growing up with you. 

What else do I need to explore to exorcise the drum shame and further exorcise this blame and resentment towards my parents? 

Part of it all tied to Jess too, making the decision somewhat to spite her. Embarrassment partially comes from this being impressive to no one but Jess (in my head) so there's a lot tying this down since it seems pointless to throw points into something I'm insecure about and ""uncommitted"" to, saying that because part of me is looking for someone to take care of me so I can give up. In other words, I'm specifically growing this for her in a lot of ways, even if that's not the primary drive.","",0,false,Markdown

I'd rather I guess they talk out only because I think I don't know giving it to chat. GPT might be a good thing but also it just helps me to deal with it in different ways. I feel like I've been circling around this for a long time, but I just I feel ashamed being a drummer. It's weird because like I don't know I don't feel like this conversation is going to change my direction at all like I think at the end of the day it's still what I see myself doing and what I mean I know that I want to do and I'm willing to be wrong about that if it comes to it, butI find my happiest moments in life are always around the drums. It's like each time I come back to try to trust this. I find myself getting distracted or trying to avoid it or something rather but like it I mean, truthfully I am ashamed to play the drums. I'm ashamed that my career path is around music you know that that I'm trying to like make a living Profiting off of numbing people's minds. Which isn't at all what it is it's just I don't know. I feel like I keep looking for a reason and reasoning to want to sell what I do you know to enjoy what I do to feel like me teaching other people it helps them to grow in somewhere shape or form. I keep wanting to believe that what I'm doing is important But I don't. I feel like I'm constantly trying to justify it in my head like what I do and what I wanna do and even if it feels like it's the only thing I can do and the only thing I truly give that amount of my life and that amount of my time to is just I just don't know how to justify it like I don't know how to tell people when there's a war going on and when the government is the way it is and you know when I could be making money that what I do is I teach people how to hit things you know just trying to justify it to find more reasons to enjoy it more and like I do like you know going to jazz jams I feel inspired or listening and studying music. I feel inspired or progressing when I talk to people about music I feel educated about it. It's just when I think about trying to sell what I do you know like to tell people I teach drum lessons to try to show up for an audition to try and record music with people like everywhere I go I feel like shame. It used to be that I felt burdened in different ways like I think it used to be that the question was you know why me of anyone you know why does it? Why do I deserve to succeed or why should I be chosen to record something when there's someone else available you know why do I deserve this? Why do I deserve that even if I don't but now the question isn't like as much about deserving it's just it doesn't make sense to me to want to do this and to put so much time and energy. I know it when I don't know I guess the money is never gonna be good for some reason it's become a focus. I guess just because it's an insecurity of mine, especially being around people that are wealthy is hard to want to tell people that that's what I do you know like it feels like a restriction to my career my love life my friendships. It's like a area of insecurity that I don't know how to deal with it like I don't know I just I guess I wanna get to a point where I see what I'm doing as being critical you know like see what I'm doing as is being as like important as a doctor or a lawyer or a surgeon or CEO because it feels like having that level of authority or respect or something like that lends itself to having just a surgical precision about what you do and I want that on drums but it's so hard to find value in that or to want to share that with someone else and I just I guess I feel like I'm just cynical and insecure and I'm frustrated with how long it takes and annoyed with the whole process because it feels like there's always something you know right now like my struggle is I don't know like I guess it's nice that the things I struggle with now are different. You know like a year ago it was the question of whether or not I deserve this and now it's a question of how do I truly believe that this has a value or that what I'm doing for people creates value like I guess now it's good that the question isn't if I deserve it so much as it is what can I do to make sure that I deserve it, but this shame has always been here and I think it just goes under different names and I don't know I think in getting into selling and persuading and trying to build this as a business. I'm having to confront this fact that like I don't know how to justify what I do I don't know how to have a good conscious telling people that yeah I played drums for a living I make art I'm an artistic fucker who's really emotional and it just creates so much insecurity right now it's like an elephant in the room that I keep trying to avoid and it's just it doesn't go away and there's always this part of me. That's like it would be so much easier if I just got like a well paying job that I could mindlessly slave away for eight hours a day just so I could have the money and the security of telling someone that I have a stable job so I could be more of a provider. It's just it sucks feeling like I'm such a mooch or a leech or a maggot and I think part of it is that I put so much on this thing as being the only thing that stands between me and you know financial security and a relationship which are deeper areas in my life that I still have to deal with, but I don't know I just I hate how this feels. I hate feeling like I'm ashamed of what I love to do feeling like I have to be closeted about the fact that I'm a musician I don't work on airplanes. I don't shoot people in war when I tell people what to do. It's for music you know it's not for anything necessary for survival. It's just entertaining. It takes your mind off of things. It helps you to connect to other people you're really just fucking sucks it's like I feel like I need to go through this I just I wanna be with the shame and the guilt so I wanna feel like I'm doing something important and memorable and it just doesn't feel like I am. I feel like I'm being a coward and like I'm fighting this war on art and like I'm losing.

I dont really want application right now like I know the letting go procedure I just feel myself trying to numb trying to escape or trying to rationalize it all when I just know the truth and it makes me feel right now like I hate drums not genuinely but I hate the fucking world we live in and how it makes us feel ashamed to pursue art like what I’m doing is unimportant or stupid or something I hate that my whole family fucking perpetuates the delusion of fiscal importance over happiness I hate it all right now I hate feeling ashamed of what I love I hate that I feel like selling lessons is just fucking manipulating people into giving me money for something I see as being so fucking worthless like what I do is worth nothing what I provide has no value and I give nothing to society nothing to people either than disappointment and disatisfaction and I’m just ranting but I’m so fucking angry at how much this has fucking plagued my life how for years now I’ve been dealing with the fucking emotional toll of having parents who made me so fucking scared all the time who didn’t teach me how to function like a normal human being who made me afraid to chase my dreams for never teaching me how to stand up for myself for apologizing for my existence for never teaching me how to even talk to a girl for making me avoid eye contact and now I resent them for it every time I sit with them I’m stressed because I have all this pent up rage and frustration towards them for how they created me how they treated me how they grew me they hurt me I was their fucking kid and my dad abandoned me both of them expected the fucking world of me without ever teaching me how to do a god damn thing I had to learn it all on my own and I’m fucking sick of them thinking they did such a good fucking Kobe because every time I sit at a dinner table with them or anyone else in my fucking family I have to sit on the fucking edge of my seat the entire time because the look they give me that fucking look they act so fucking worried about me as if I don't know what that means as if I don't know that they'd wished I'd taken the easy way the fucking corporate sell out route the path where I mean nothing and am nothing fuck them fuck them fuck them fuck those fucking cunts.

It's been good in some ways and bad in others. I'm coming back from this trip with the same kind of mental change that I felt coming back from California. I think it's growth in that it's with other people this time, but it feels that way. I feel like a new direction is on the horizon and I'm still mentally trying to process everything. Like the seeds have been planted for a whole new line. It's so much different than like a family vacation. Those ones are known. Somewhat predictable. Lots of love, lots of recovery, but not always the life changing reflection I need. There's too much similarity there, too much comfort. A risky trip like this or California is much more...experiential? Expensive for sure, but being in a place I've never been before opens my eyes up to new cultures. Being around people I've never been with does the same, but in an inner circle kind of way. It's hard to explain it in any other way than it feels like a type of soul food or fertilizer, kinda of seeds for whole new life directions and whole new risks.

- Never feel alone or lonely because everyone is my people
- No need for walls
- No anxiety in communication or connection
- Always a new opportunity 
- More friends, and better friends

- terrified they'll lash out at me
- They'll kill me
- they'll hurt me
- They'll rob me
- They'll go after my family next
- They're toxic and a poison to my life
- They're better than me and they'll hate me for being so small

Okay so like what are all the honest feelings I have about Spare Change?

I dread gigs with them. The music is good, but as people it's the same woe as me attitude as I felt with Amy and Jess and Brandi. I don't feel inspired to grow with them. I hate having to drive for them. I hate the effort I have to expend for them. I hate feeling like if I'm not doing anything the band isn't progressing, and in the same way holding the band back by not showing the enthusiasm I expect from them. I'm mad at myself for never choosing to prioritize them. I hate how this looks for future bands and future relationships, because I've done so much work to convince myself that if it were the right people then I would put all my effort into it and I'm scared that I'm waiting for the right people to put absolutely any effort into and I villainize them but it's this really fucking confusing middle ground where I can't figure out if I'm the problem for not putting effort in or if I've stopped putting effort in because it stopped being rewarded and I just fucking hate how this looks for my life and my career if I'm looking for any reason to not play live shows because I know live gigs terrify me much more than I let off but I also love them and I haven't done it in a while and I miss it but I hate it and it's like I want to start auditioning for bigger and better gigs soon but why should I deserve those if I won't even practice for the gigs I have it's just so fucking frustrating because I constantly come to this dilemma of like would this band actually work if I tried or is it a fucking waste of time? Are they self sabotaging or am I? And I love them as people but I've now experienced what it's like to be part of a completely synergistic team which would stop at nothing to be amazing and it doesn't feel like I can do that with them like they'll never have that level of standard and I put it all on myself some part of me feels like the resolution is to commit to what I have and if I try hard enough and put enough energy in it might motivate them to do the same but another part of me thinks I need to just keep looking for people who are already driven like that and this other part that thinks I won't find that until I prove to the universe that I'm capable of putting my energy into something even if it doesn't pay anything and I feel unmotivated by almost like I have to clear this hurtle where I prove to the universe that even surrounded by people who don't motivate me I can survive and motivate and carry the team I have without giving them any credit but then another side of me says that's fucking stupid and abusive and it's the hard way and I'm so confused about it all that I can't stop stress eating and playing video games I can't prioritize what actually matters to me and it's all fucking dumb","",0,false,Markdown

- Reciprocity 
- Perceptual contrast

Would be good to look at other sales channels and see what techniques are being used.


> The additional advantage of the technique is not really a psychological principle, as in the case of the other two factors. Rather, it is more of a purely structural feature of the request sequence. Let's once again say that I wish to borrow $10 from you. By beginning with a request for $20, I really can't lose. If you agree to it, I will have received from you twice the amount I would have settled for. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat to the $10 favor that I desired from the outset and, through the action of the reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my likelihood of success. Either way, I benefit; it's a case of heads I win, tails you lose.

The ethical side of this is genuinely wanting to give them the highest experience possible (most expensive), but making concessions to meet them where they are.

THIS IS HOW TO TAKE BREAKS AND REST MINDFULLY. It requires setting intentions at the start of each day, recognizing what is possible. Working with the day/week/month instead of trying to force it to fit. Like today, I get done with work at 5:30, but the boundary I set for myself is no drum after that. If my work schedule keeps shifting that can change, but the general rule is no heavy focus 2 hours before bed. Saving money and eating healthier can also be heavily reinforced that way, as well as other goals.

I constantly prioritized her comfort over my entertainment, staying present and with her throughout instead of working through my own tasks. On the way, I still found beauty in the sunrise and in the morning I found beauty in the nostalgia from driving back from gigs. All in all it feels like I've begun prioritizing the health and wellbeing of loved ones over financial setbacks, realizing that that's all they are. #progress","",0,false,Markdown

At the same time, I feel like I'm blind to it. Maybe from desire. Because when I went to midtown the other day, I saw 3 bands playing on the sidewalk. What's stopping me from making friends with them? It feels like it's connected to the same resistances that came up in Elementary school, being rejected by them. Only making friends with the outliers or people I had ""control"" over.","",0,false,Markdown

Was conflicted on masturbating to sadistic fantasies last night (compulsively) and body ended up defaulting to a more loving one. Still being stepped on but from a place of safety, comfort, belonging #progress","",0,false,Markdown

This, as well as starting the month without realistic intentions and having unrealistic goals for my time made it impossible to reach most of what I strived for. A lot of this comes from (1) not approaching months with any ideas rooted in reality (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just means since it still pushes me) and (2) not re-evaluating this goal when planning each week.","",0,false,Markdown
