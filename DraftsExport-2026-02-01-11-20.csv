All these changes and growing into groove make me question if I've been numb all this time and avoiding myself. Things like sleep seem to come naturally to those who listen to themselves

It feels effortless getting lost in something good, I'd like that to apply without the criticality, and I feel like that is the only thing that truly disintegrates my absorption

Like when I think about it, I'm always so anxious about my part that I can't get lost in the beauty of music. And now I think that's where I'm wrong

Also noticed today tha after a night struggling not to masturbate, today I was more attached to women at Target again. Highly correlated I bet

I think where I struggle with both groove and emotion may stem from like anxiety? But also…it's a lot to explain. So I started today with a long meditation, and something I've always noticed is I've never really felt my breath in my back. Nor have I felt any other emotion? And I think it confused me. When I think about Art, a lot of what I've made comes from an emotional place, but I've hardly been able to say the same with drum and groove. It's this point where I can listen to something later and feel good about it, but in the moment I can't listen never really listen to what I'm playing and feel anything with it. And I think it connects to all the hypercritical lenses I've adopted throughout my life where I can't just enjoy my playing, which has made it hard to enjoy all music. And I think I can't enjoy music because I get into that analytical mode, and once I'm in that mode it's like the only thing I feel is pride. So I guess I'm at a point where conceptually I understand what it means to get lost in music, to understand it, to enjoy it, but the number of times I've experienced that are few and far between. Even my favorite players, I get into this mental battle with. And I think part of that hits into why I struggle just listening to music or just reading a book or just watching movie: because I panic over struggling to get lost in it OR enter analytical mode OR productive mode and feel it's a waste of time, and I'm sure what I'm actually experiencing is an amalgamation of the three. And I think I struggle to let go of this lens because in my eyes it's been what's grown me so much, almost like the hypercritical nature has driven extraordinary results (although I'm not entirely sure that's the case) or at least it would if I kept up with it","",0,false,Markdown

- Last ditch intensity clutch
- Way of dismissing fantasies in the past was overusing them
- Staying small

- Outskirts of relationship
- Delusion that this brings me closer to a relationship 
	- It's genuinely pushing me farther away, I can feel it intruding again
- Closeness
- Not having to do any of the work is pleasurable
- Get to feel both sides of it
- Cuteness factor? Adoration?
- Familiarity 
- Still a large element of belonging (to her)
- There's some kind of pleasure derived from allowing her to continue thinking what she's doing is harmless. Like somehow, my (unknown) misery contributes to her happiness and pleasure. I see this when she finished playing with me with her feet (socks on) during a movie. She's got this subtle, contented smile before putting me back in her shoe again. Same with when she move me from ass to slipper. Like I'm willing to suffer it thinking there's no other way and no way out
Holding onto these things keeps me stuck. The harm:
- Staring at peoples feet, looking for a moment to stare down (noticed this with Zoe this morning)
- Following women
- Relationships where I choose misery
- Makes eye contact and connection difficlt
- Loss of presence as I sink further into the fantasy

I think before, I was thinking the solution would be to listen to more music, which may be a part of it, but the idea that revolved around my head is that I can't tell where the musical conversation is going, where the energy is, what it feels like, etc. I've started thinking about natural conversation and maybe I'm overthinking it. Real conversations improves by talking to people, immersing yourself in the culture. Emotion arises as a byproduct of this, not by means of trying to illicit certain emotions (which can be done) but instead by allowing the emotions to speak through you. And I think the only way I'm going to get better at that, at understanding what other people are saying in musical conversation, is to play more with more people. And I think it's obvious now why I'm uneducated here: it's a skill you develop while socializing. I've hardly jammed with anyone or for any notable lengths of time. These people likely for years would do it everyday for hours. Storytelling only comes in afterwards. I think I'm focused so much on on the bigger picture that I don't even have the small one yet

The goal of being an anchor is being so secure in yourself that you can go anywhere and stay true to yourself. As true in Music as in Life.

Stating to think that the appeal of books is to learn without having to experience failure and embarrassment 

I think one of the reasons I struggle to tell people about my dreams or whatever maybe not tell them about it so much as like create any kind of self affirmation for it is because I don't believe it and I don't have evidence for it. Like I think about the idea of talking to someone that I would want to date and telling them I'm a drummer, or even when I had a conversation with Chandler or when I talk with family about it all, I feel like I'm lying to them half the time. We're looking for like real world evidence that proves what I'm talking about and maybe it's not so much. I'm trying to prove it to them as I am trying to prove it to myself, but what ends up happening most of the time is, I don't falsify evidence, but I complete the value of certain things, like right now I think about telling people that I'm now getting mentorship from a Grammy winning Drummer or light… I don't know. I think there's a distance between something I create and the effect it has for the emotion it creates. Like I think I can create something from a certain emotion but the way it actually comes out. You know the intention for it is very disconnected from that. It seems like. And I think a lot of times that process is just I guess I'm back-and-forth? It's like you try something and you see how it performs and then you improve off of it or you edit it to match the intentions further. In the way this ties back into what I was talking about is like if I'm going in to try and tell people that you know I'm a drummer. It feels like I'm lying half the time and I think for the longest time what I thought was that people were judging me for saying that, but I think now I'm starting to see that it's not that it's that I don't believe that when I say it so there's no way anyone else is gonna believe me because I'm saying it from a place of disbelief which creates an error of disbelief. I think I have to like, feel it and truly believe that I am a professional drummer, not only that I'm a professional book that I'm a drumming, legend and then letting go of any need to have like evidence to validate that or something. Almost seems like a dangerous tool to believe in something even though there's no evidence it's true. But isn't that just faith?

- So many assumptions about what I'm not doing

- Afraid of unrealistic or immoral aspirations

I look at people like Larnell Lewis or Seth Godin or Keith Ferrazzi or Stephen King or Jojo Mayer or John Mayer would've done where I am and…they're all known as individuals, but that wasn't the case in their 20's I bet. There's very limited people tha are. And I think that's what makes it hard where I am right now, trying to build my own path as a personal brand, entrepreneur, and artist. I can't even understand my intentions right now, or if this idea isn't just a way of resisting/delaying the hard work. I look at what they've become and it's hard to imagine them working in someone else's business, especially in a way related to their own passions. I feel like so long I've resisted working in someone else's company because it felt inauthentic or like it ran counter to my goals. Ironically, that's what brought me to Starbucks. The idea that it was flexible part time work with benefits that I could gig outside of. I didn't want to overextend myself into music by teaching and practicing out of fear of burnout, but the more I fall in love with Music the less that feels likely. Almost like I had to get used to the performance and the practice and get comfortable with them before I took on more practical related work like teaching. It almost feels like what's made me resist going and working for a lessons company was largely due to ego, resistance to community. Now that I'm unpacking that, it feels like starting my own thing would be lonely in the moment. And I guess that's where I get caught up now. If I started my own thing, I'd have to continue going at it alone. I can't yet afford to have others in the process. I don't know what or whose problems I'd be solving by starting something on my own. And I definitely couldn't do it as well as some of these other companies. It's like…now I see I could make more (in the short term), connect with others, and learn how to teach all while getting a better structure all by just playing a role in someone else's business.
