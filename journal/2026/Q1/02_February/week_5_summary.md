# Week 5

---

## Summary


This week was all about community and rest. In all endeavors, I put myself out there to connect more. I went to Caleb's bonfire and reconnected/jammed with all my friends in the Athens scene. Even got another potential student (two including the one Jill might set me up with)! During the run club on Saturday, I talked to two recurring runners and ended up running the first 6 miles with them. There were multiple women who I also had extended conversations with, both of them becoming flirtatious after a while. Even in these, I've felt more and more the difference between connection and isolation, specifically the circumstances that create them. When I was well rested and well fed, my natural state became ambition and, so long as I'd prepared some itinerary, I was quick to follow through. The most notable rest was that on Thursday, my body said to rest and I listened. On Friday, I felt sick, so I called out of work and slept all day. Because of these things, I was able to get more practice time in, not out of forcing myself but out of gravitational pull. The only real pain of the week was the spread of intentions along with the continued exacerbated withdrawal from masturbation.

### Friction


<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->

1. Didn't really complete anyting I set out to do
	- Combination of needing rest, not knowing when I dont need rest, and continued friction from withdrawls consuming every ounce of energy I have to live
2. Want a more definitive structure for growing jazz. Something steady and boilerplate at the moment that I can just say "for this length of time, do xyz."
3. Attention being divided between clearing out all my old shit and applying for jobs is making it difficult to do either
4. Maddie wont stop fucking barking and it drives me insane and makes it impossible to sleep
5. Withdrawls
6. Too exhausted right now to come up with concrete things, frequently too exhausted it feels like, but right now especially anxious
7. Lack of intention, lack of strength behind intentions
8. Frequently missing meditations
9. With the past two, could be burn out territory. Especially considering all the changes (cutting out dopamine, jazz jam, run club, looking for new jobs, trying to build business, etc) starting to feel at the end of my rope. Even multiple day long rests arent exactly cutting it with the amoutn of recovery im needing

## Review

### What stopped you from achieving last week's goals?

The withdrawls are consuming much more energy that I'd ever anticipated, especially at this stage. It's a combination of that and not getting enough rest from the insomnia it causes. But even outside of that, I think my intentions are divided between too many areas of focus which is making willpower lackluster. Like right now, I'm focused on
- Improving in jazz
- Improving diet to run better
- Working out more consistently
- Relaxing more
- Applying for lessons companies
- Getting my own students
- Decluttering my space
- Withdrawls
- Being able to afford more things

### What does life look like at the end of the week?
