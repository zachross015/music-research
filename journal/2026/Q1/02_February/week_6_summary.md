# Week 6

---

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the week in 1000 characters or less. -->

This week was full of numbness and a derived sense of panic. Finally made friends at the run club and jazz jam. In doing so, I've been subject to a slew of new insecurities that have been uncovered and have been forced to deal with them. I fully believe the reason I was thrust into this numbness and lack of motivation was because of th 15 mile run I'd taken previously, which drained all my resources and shocked my nervous system. Over the course of the week, I'd confronted the slew of community-based issues that have been developed in my lifetime. Those being performativeness, a lack of curiosity, malicious intentions (in the form of instant gratification with women), a desire for relief, lack of presence, confusion in conversations, and shapeshifting to fit the needs of the group (moreso to either dissapear or create dependence). Towards the end of the week, I began noticing the anxieties revolving around a mistrust in my own voice. I had chosen my current path as yet another way to feel superior to othes, happier than them, which became apparent in my conflicts with my mom and Mimza. In unpacking this, I'm having to redefine my relationship to community in a way that stops trying to be a critical component and instead seeks to provide value and joy in a way that is consistent and aligns with my strengths/values. I'm leaving the week redefining my role as less of a "hero" and more just a member.

### Achievements

<!-- Write out what accomplishments you made over the week. -->
1. Made 8 new friends at the run club!
2. Didn't masturbate
3. Cleared almost all of the clutter from my room.
4. Practicing licks (exclusively) has made storytelling with licks much easier.

### Friction

<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->
- Hardly did any deep listening to jazz music
- Clutter is still prominent in my basement. Really need to clear it all out so i can move on to the next project
- I think recovery for longer runs is going to depend on a much cleaner diet and more dilligent resting than I have provided it
