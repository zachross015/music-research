Is it better to study one album a week? Or just everything on shuffle with an open mind?

I feel like there’s a detached sense of temptation now? Like there’ll be a lot of times where my mind is coming up with new concepts and fantasies to indulge in, and I’ll be lying in bed thinking “what’s the point?” I feel like attraction from real stimulus is growing, whereas things I see online kind of lose their luster. I look forward to a day when getting off is something between me and someone else, almost entirely from physical stimulation instead of needing the fantasy. I look back on old relationships and see why they didn’t appeal to me, because it was so performative. I was having to create mental stimulation instead of any presence. And now I see nearly all my relationships in a more connected light, where I’m looking to talk more, validate more, be more present. And I had no security because I couldnt deal with the emotions on my own outside of drowning myself in my addictions. I feel like the biggest change I’m starting to see is a much stronger ability to stay present and focused in “risky” situations. I think it all made relationships hard too because so much was always on the line. I didn’t connect with them so much as I performed connection with them. I didn’t trust myself to survive if everything went wrong because whenever they did, I gave up on everything and had no emotional outlets. And I think because I was only actually connecting with people in relationships, it made every interpersonal turbulence appear as if it was specifically a relationship issue. But now that I feel that deeper connection, I can actually practice those interpersonal problems with everyone and spend more time in riskier situations to build my confidence. All of it kind of works together to bring this much stronger presence than I’ve ever felt before. It’s improved my ability to play music just as much as it has my ability to connect 

It's just really nice that I don't really struggle to hold eye contact. I'm not reaching to leave conversation or a moment with someone. I can stand watching someone be themselves, maybe get cringed out if they're weird, and still feel safe.

Once I get proficient enough in jazz and have my network, can start a quartet in any town and do a residency like Goron Vernick.

The troubling thing I found last night was that masturbation, especially at night, is a form of soothing. When all these negative thoughts were running through my mind, I got pulled to masturbating just to shut the thoughts up. I didn't finish on purpose, I basically just did it until the thoughts calmed down. Forced myself into it too because everything else was just depressing, at least the sexual thoughts were energizing. Is there any better way to go about this?

Thinking about the past, I've always used it in this way. Like every time I would get into a grief loop, it was always my way out. It's another thing that needs a different habit. 

The good thing is that the stimulus has declined. I tried thinking about the old stuff, and I'm convinced what was really getting me off was the physical sensation and less about the fantasy. It's just not that appealing anymore. And it feels like even if I tried really hard, I'd not be able to finish with it now.

Been hitting snooze a lot today and yesterday and skipping meditation. Wondering now (having avoided signals for so long) if this isn't just a sign I need more rest? Starting to think so. Feel exhaustion today.

Crazy thing is, now that I decided to move towards a company, I finally want to pay someone else for a color scheme. Almost like I was just getting in my own way and making it too high stakes. Needed to let it go.

Also starting to notice more of what it means to surrender a relationship with yourself and instead be in full relationship with others.

Final thing: noticed that the beautiful women came back to Starbucks today. Haven't felt urges recently, and even then I didn't feel a compulsion to stare at. It's made me realize, I haven't even learned their names. Like there's so many customers I've built a relationship with. Why not them? I feel like I've been too intimidated, scared, and insecure because of everything else. Finally feel like I'm starting to gain tha confidence

At a point where I trust my actions and feelings over thoughts

The more I sit with this feeling, the more I see I haven't been recovering well enough

Shoes have become more of a curiosity today than a sexual urge

I feel like I leave conversations with Mimza feeling angry now. For no like real reason?
- Hard time communicating properly
- Like her
- Need to feel validated by her, or seen, in a way I'm not being seen

The next level of ear training i think revolves around both deepening intervals and learning to hear chord progressions as much as chords.

Different pricing tiers result in different planning levels. Eg week by week, can only plan for the next week. For a month, can plan out whole month. Same for quarter and year.
$90/hr/week
x .95/month (includes month plan)
x .9/quarter (includes quarter plan)
x .85/year (includes year plan)

Had to call out sick today. I feel like shit, especially my head. Started feeling it yesterday and it got worse over night. It's not like deathly ill, just annoyingly lethargic and slightly nauseating. What I'm noticing with it is it's still really hard to understand when relaxing is needed versus when pushing. Hard to trust I'm making the right decision here. 

When I listen for what I'm meant to do today, the voice says relax. I hear it, and I think about how yesterday was Al's supposed to relax. Maybe I didn't relax though, I went up to north Georgia and walked around. I ate like shit, and it makes me wonder if that's why I feel this way today.

I've started to think about most days in the same context of marathon training. You only do long runs one day a week, and the other days have much shorter, more intense workouts. Having a bad diet one day completely changes the capacity to work out the next day. Same with rest. And in that view, I feel like my view on rest relaxation is opening its awareness to how little it's there. I don't feel like I'm eating enough of the right foods, sleeping enough, or just relaxing enough to recover from some of my workouts (much less everything else going on) and I think video gaming / other addictions were ways to numb this. Without it, I just see how much these are not ingrained. It's no wonder I'd burn out so frequently if these were my working habits.

Woke up thinking a lot about Riza. Been doing that quite a bit the past couple days.

A lot of desire I need to delve into. The fantasies with Riza, running clothes, money for events, new jobs, etc. Intentions are spread right now making focus hard. Keep thinking it's needing rest, but I'm starting to think that's not it. Or at least if it is, I need a longer break. Like I need a time to settle the current changes and gather energy for the new ones. 

Want to make bed better, as a gesture to my future self. Not just for aesthetic, but preparing it for the best sleep.

Sitting in a restaurant, the waitress keeps getting close to me. There's nothing sensual about her in particular, but I feel drawn to her closeness like a magnet. I want to hold her, grab her by the waist and pull her in. Press my face against her and melt into her. I started feeling this last night too, watching women in the ice skating Olympics. The way they danced and you couldn't tell wear one body ended and the other began...I wanted it. To be part of that dance, that melding. It's so beautiful and sensual.

And I find myself more drawn to stoicism. With all that's changed, it's hard to pinpoint where my effort is spent. It almost all seems toward larger and more community-oriented objectives, but my brain feels lost in how simple and easy it feels right now to do harder things. It makes me uncomfortable
