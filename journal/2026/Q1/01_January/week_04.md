The weight of groove has started sinking in. It doesn't feel any different from meditation in that the goal of it is to stay with the object of focus and letting go of distractions as they come and go. In the context of groove, it seems it's moreso about staying consistent with time, relaxing into it, and not explicitly reacting to others playing without intention. I think when coming from roc and metal, it's been hard to understand this concept since most the parts were so syncopated. That and the fact tha I've had such a technique focus has made me aware of how little I know how to use my chops effectively. I think I relied too much on them as a means of "storytelling," really trying to impress rather than trying to groove and enjoy. But this whole approach has made me see just how much more important it is to stick to the same part regardless of the changes going on around you, at least until fills and other supportive playing can be done intentionally 

From now on, rubbing dick against bed counts as gooning.

With my revelation at the gig last week, I feel like part of the changes coming in (or at least that I need to make) are a deeper appreciation and experience of live experiences. Not just music, but being able to bypass the connection issues is going to make it so much easier to experience this, and I feel like the better I can feel this stuff live and around others the easier it's going to be to channel that into everything else I make. But this whole color pallet feels like a great first look into that, into being able to convey a feeling or experience to someone else

The thought continues to deepen in me, that I need to learn how to feel more and suppress less. Not only feel more, but experience more, and learn how to articulate those things in any medium. That's what listening really means, and the better I get at this, the better all experiences will be. ESPECIALLY performing

Watching Pluribus, there's times I get lost in it. It makes me think, being a part of something and feeling something is about surrendering to it. Awareness sure, but completely surrendering to it. I think I've always been so hyper aware of myself and my actions and my perceptions, monitoring my surroundings and others reactions, that I haven't allowed myself to just surrender to it. Likely applies to sleep just as much as community. Wonder where that stems from

"I got the chance a few years ago to watch a famous trainer work with his thoroughbreds. I had
imagined that the process would be something hard-core like Navy SEAL training. To my surprise, the sessions were more like play.
The work was serious, as in teaching the two-year-olds to enter the starting gate, and the horses were definitely learning. But the trainer took pains to make the schooling feel like fun. When a horse got tired, the trainer took him off the track. If a mount got bored or restive, the trainer never forced him to continue or drove him “through the pain.”
He explained:
A horse is a flight animal. Even a stallion, if he can, will choose flight over confrontation.
Picture the most sensitive person you’ve ever known; a horse is ten times more sensitive. A horse is a naked nervous system, particularly a thoroughbred. He’s a child. A three-yearold, big and fast as he is, is a baby. Horses understand the whip, but I don’t want a racer that runs that way. A horse that loves to run will beat a horse that’s compelled, every day of the week.
I want my horses to love the track. I want my exercise riders to have to hold them back in the morning because they’re so excited to get out and run.
Never train your horse to exhaustion. Leave him wanting more."
- Turning Pro, Stephen Pressfield

"The professional refuses to be iconized. Not for selfish reasons, but because he knows how destructive the dynamic of iconization is to the iconizer. The pro will share his wisdom with other professionals—or with amateurs who are committed to becoming professionals." 
- Turning Pro, Stephen Pressfield

"In a way I was lucky that I experienced failure for so many years. Because there were no
conventional rewards, I was forced to ask myself, Why am I doing this? Am I crazy? All my friends are making money and settling down and living normal lives. What the hell am I doing? Am I nuts? What’s wrong with me?
In the end I answered the question by realizing that I had no choice. I couldn’t do anything else. When I tried, I got so depressed I couldn’t stand it. So when I wrote yet another novel or screenplay that I couldn’t sell, I had no choice but to write another after that. The truth was, I was enjoying myself. Maybe nobody else liked the stuff I was doing, but I did. I was learning. I was getting better.
The work became, in its own demented way, a practice. It sustained me, and it sustains me still."

Not a bad #idea to do a documentary series with Evan on different drumming styles

Wonder and awe come from expansiveness

All these changes and growing into groove make me question if I've been numb all this time and avoiding myself. Things like sleep seem to come naturally to those who listen to themselves

It feels effortless getting lost in something good, I'd like that to apply without the criticality, and I feel like that is the only thing that truly disintegrates my absorption

Like when I think about it, I'm always so anxious about my part that I can't get lost in the beauty of music. And now I think that's where I'm wrong

Also noticed today tha after a night struggling not to masturbate, today I was more attached to women at Target again. Highly correlated I bet

I think where I struggle with both groove and emotion may stem from like anxiety? But also…it's a lot to explain. So I started today with a long meditation, and something I've always noticed is I've never really felt my breath in my back. Nor have I felt any other emotion? And I think it confused me. When I think about Art, a lot of what I've made comes from an emotional place, but I've hardly been able to say the same with drum and groove. It's this point where I can listen to something later and feel good about it, but in the moment I can't listen never really listen to what I'm playing and feel anything with it. And I think it connects to all the hypercritical lenses I've adopted throughout my life where I can't just enjoy my playing, which has made it hard to enjoy all music. And I think I can't enjoy music because I get into that analytical mode, and once I'm in that mode it's like the only thing I feel is pride. So I guess I'm at a point where conceptually I understand what it means to get lost in music, to understand it, to enjoy it, but the number of times I've experienced that are few and far between. Even my favorite players, I get into this mental battle with. And I think part of that hits into why I struggle just listening to music or just reading a book or just watching movie: because I panic over struggling to get lost in it OR enter analytical mode OR productive mode and feel it's a waste of time, and I'm sure what I'm actually experiencing is an amalgamation of the three. And I think I struggle to let go of this lens because in my eyes it's been what's grown me so much, almost like the hypercritical nature has driven extraordinary results (although I'm not entirely sure that's the case) or at least it would if I kept up with it

Conflicted on how to deal with the jazz jam stuff. Part of me wants to do the old way of doing extensive research to compile what's likely going to show up, and another part wants to show up not knowing anything and act like a pro and learn on the spot. Maybe make jams a homework? Always show up, mark the songs, the learn afterwards. May as well just go through jams online

Last night was an incredibly difficult one. Tossing and turning and doing anything not to goon. But I woke up this morning and thought to myself “I did it.” Made it through another night fellas 💪 - posted this on I Am Sober. Getting a better inclination to involve myself in community

Comaeux is a red head that wears a lot of teal 👀

I have to let go of her. She's sitting in the lobby and I keep looking to her for some kind of attention, affirmation, really just staring at her teal Nikes. It makes me wonder if age difference is all that big of a deal. I imagine her down the line being a runner, adventurer, whatever. She's a hard worker. Could it be Her? But it feels weird in a way. If I wasn't at home, would it? Holding onto her drains me and I know this, it also makes it impossible to move on. She has a lot of the qualities but I'm also looking at potential and not reality.

On the other side, I let myself relax into the conversation with her. I sat at the table next to her, and conversation just flowed. Not forcing curiosity, but instead walking with it when it arrived. I didn't feel discomforted by silence. Noticed that by not trying to control it or predict it, I was more in flow with it and connected deeper. Even remembered more than I thought I would. 

Also noticed with Kevin this morning, he was upset (we all were) and said some things. There was tension, and although I didn't react, I felt it. Noticed this internal sense of responsibility to calm him, control him and his emotions in a way. I let these things go and didn't fall in, he ended up trying to "fix" it afterwards. Residual of childhood I think. I'm curious where it comes feom

What about an annual clinic which is just presenting/bringing together findings on cultural drumming? Like fly in great educators in different genres (eg this year jazz people, next year Afro Cuban legends) and teaching about the roots and growth of genre based on those things. "Exploring the world through drums" #ideas

Another hallmark of connection is being able to stay with yourself in the present, in conversation, in a calm and mindful way

How do you begin to separate analytical mode form presence mode? Different hats? Leave it on the field. Analyze later. It takes up too much brain power to be the observer and the observed simultaneously 

Karma debt works the same way as financial debt. I think it gathers interest over time so that below the level of courage, emotions conspire to push you down, but after courage they do the opposite.

How can I expect my company to stick to a budget if I can't?

I think the recent kinks are really my body's way of sexually gratifying discipline. Like it all seems to surround this emotion of "this is going to suck, but She'll feel good for it" and some part of that makes me feel good? In experiencing both of them

Have to accept that looking at women's shoes is a form of porn for me, especially when I get in that mode.

Why am I holding onto this fantasy in particular?
- Last ditch intensity clutch
- Way of dismissing fantasies in the past was overusing them
- Staying small
- pleasure in discipline, especially of pleasing Her
- Outskirts of relationship
- Delusion that this brings me closer to a relationship 
	- It's genuinely pushing me farther away, I can feel it intruding again
- Closeness
- Not having to do any of the work is pleasurable
- Get to feel both sides of it
- Cuteness factor? Adoration?
- Familiarity 
- Still a large element of belonging (to her)
- There's some kind of pleasure derived from allowing her to continue thinking what she's doing is harmless. Like somehow, my (unknown) misery contributes to her happiness and pleasure. I see this when she finished playing with me with her feet (socks on) during a movie. She's got this subtle, contented smile before putting me back in her shoe again. Same with when she move me from ass to slipper. Like I'm willing to suffer it thinking there's no other way and no way out
Holding onto these things keeps me stuck. The harm:
- Staring at peoples feet, looking for a moment to stare down (noticed this with Zoe this morning)
- Following women
- Relationships where I choose misery
- Makes eye contact and connection difficlt
- Loss of presence as I sink further into the fantasy
Learn to hold and harness the energy without acting on it. It CAN be a superpower if you learn to do this.

How do I let go of this?

Noticed it in public the first time today, the way I allow myself to experience misery for the benefit of others. Mohan came in and I didn't ask him how he was doing this time, knowing it would only bring me down. May be a sign of my boundary-less existence? Starting to see ways I'll absorb others suffering to create a better environment. But now, I feel like I've started to recognize a better way. It's possible to surround yourself with uplifting people who don't harp on misery, or at least where consuming their misery isn't part of the pleasure of being around them

From this perspective, horniness may always just be a tool for lacking?

Ways I've noticed it impacts me:
- predilection for being ignored (and hyperfocusing on attractive people doing that)
	- Her attention destroys the illusion
- Not initiating conversation/ waiting for them to take the lead and take control (more pleasure in them taking ownership)
	- Putting myself in an environment where I'm surrounded by people (eg jazz jam) becomes draining because I wait on everyone in the room to make the first move
- Monitoring myself in conversation instead of relaxing into it, either moving towards or away from horniness

One change I have to make is using whatever willpower I have to AVOID STARING. Admire, don't stare, especially not from that guttural and fearful place. Noticed a bit of it today, another Hoka mom sitting in the lobby, for a while I kept coming back to look. 

Feel absolutely drained from resisting temptation all day

It may come from a good place, like a go with the flow mentality? Just horribly misconceived as spinelessness. Protecting others from my pain/discomfort?

I'm mentally looking for something here and have no idea what it is

Once I get comfortable with jam sessions: use them as opportunities to practice challenges. Eg, one note per bar, only quarter notes, etc 

Also began noticing the criticality of groove. The goal is to become so solid, so heavy, that even when you get off, you can hear the time discrepancies. Training it seems practicable apart from being on the kit, and once trained sets the baseline of awareness to constantly be in sync.

Fuck it, im playinf. And ya know what? It's about to be the BEST TIME I EVER PERFORMED FOR THIS GROUP

I DID IT. It was so fucking embarrassing and got a little lip from the bassist, but I fucking did it! Notes from them:
- Timing is good
- Soloing needs work
	- Philly Joe Jones with Red Garland, anything max roach or Roy Hanes 
- Bassist told me to
	- Push tempo
	- Quarter notes on piano solo
My own notes (haven't watched back the livestream yet):
- No idea how to comp to support. New respect for the other drummers because I had no idea what I was doing 
- It's going to be years before I'm good here. I can already feel it. It's not just about the time, it's knowing what to listen for and how to listen
- Embarrassment i feel is tantamount to when i started Starbucks. Same feeling, being a newb, fortunately the musicians there seemed opening. It'll go away with repetition
- Other embarrassment in introducing myself. Realize I hadn't done a lot of that and it's become a main practice with all the new clubs 
- Wish I could take my Starbucks confidence everywhere
- It's refreshing being surrounded by people so much better than me. I want to see it as more of a good thing and continue shaping an image of someone persistent who'll do whatever it takes to become a God of drumming. Like being surrounded by (and talking to) professionals who have made a living off of it gives me hope
- My fear of playing with people better than me is a symptom of my own superiority complex

I'm really starting to think what separates Benny Greb or Jojo Mayer from someone like Robert isn't skill, mainly business and confidence

Also noticing that social media makes everything performative. Going in last night as myself was difficult, but it felt real and something I could learn from. Had I gone in to get content, it would've painted such a bad picture in my mind

The tools of growth
- Synoptic learning
- Habit
- Discipline
- Community

What is the right affirmation for me? I don't want to be the "best" drummer in the world.
I am a drumming:
- legend
- guru
- Monk
Legend carries the best feeling so far
- Grammy-winning drummer

One limb almost always is an anchor/time keeper. Starting to see this more and more. Everything else should revolve around that part

Lacking trust = danger to me? Realizing I have to break today

When you start with money, the solution to everything becomes throw money at it. When you start at Rags to Riches, the solutions to everything require more creativity. Then, when the money comes, the solution no longer starts with money

I've been thinking a lot about this idea that there's a dimension missing from my playing, and I'm really starting to think it's the communication level. I think before, I was thinking the solution would be to listen to more music, which may be a part of it, but the idea that revolved around my head is that I can't tell where the musical conversation is going, where the energy is, what it feels like, etc. I've started thinking about natural conversation and maybe I'm overthinking it. Real conversations improves by talking to people, immersing yourself in the culture. Emotion arises as a byproduct of this, not by means of trying to illicit certain emotions (which can be done) but instead by allowing the emotions to speak through you. And I think the only way I'm going to get better at that, at understanding what other people are saying in musical conversation, is to play more with more people. And I think it's obvious now why I'm uneducated here: it's a skill you develop while socializing. I've hardly jammed with anyone or for any notable lengths of time. These people likely for years would do it everyday for hours. Storytelling only comes in afterwards. I think I'm focused so much on on the bigger picture that I don't even have the small one yet

The goal of being an anchor is being so secure in yourself that you can go anywhere and stay true to yourself. As true in Music as in Life.

"Earn attention and trust. Spend time and money on that, and the rest will take care of itself." Seth Godin

Stating to think that the appeal of books is to learn without having to experience failure and embarrassment 

I think one of the reasons I struggle to tell people about my dreams or whatever maybe not tell them about it so much as like create any kind of self affirmation for it is because I don't believe it and I don't have evidence for it. Like I think about the idea of talking to someone that I would want to date and telling them I'm a drummer, or even when I had a conversation with Chandler or when I talk with family about it all, I feel like I'm lying to them half the time. We're looking for like real world evidence that proves what I'm talking about and maybe it's not so much. I'm trying to prove it to them as I am trying to prove it to myself, but what ends up happening most of the time is, I don't falsify evidence, but I complete the value of certain things, like right now I think about telling people that I'm now getting mentorship from a Grammy winning Drummer or light… I don't know. I think there's a distance between something I create and the effect it has for the emotion it creates. Like I think I can create something from a certain emotion but the way it actually comes out. You know the intention for it is very disconnected from that. It seems like. And I think a lot of times that process is just I guess I'm back-and-forth? It's like you try something and you see how it performs and then you improve off of it or you edit it to match the intentions further. In the way this ties back into what I was talking about is like if I'm going in to try and tell people that you know I'm a drummer. It feels like I'm lying half the time and I think for the longest time what I thought was that people were judging me for saying that, but I think now I'm starting to see that it's not that it's that I don't believe that when I say it so there's no way anyone else is gonna believe me because I'm saying it from a place of disbelief which creates an error of disbelief. I think I have to like, feel it and truly believe that I am a professional drummer, not only that I'm a professional book that I'm a drumming, legend and then letting go of any need to have like evidence to validate that or something. Almost seems like a dangerous tool to believe in something even though there's no evidence it's true. But isn't that just faith?

Good first move in any genre is fully internalize the time keeper. For jazz, I think this mean making sure at all times when listening knowing what beat, wha measure, and what part of the firm you're in

What do I need to observe when listening to a song?
- Place in chorus
- Count at all times (body intuition level)
- push or pull

And I think the only way I'm going to get better at that, at understanding what other people are saying in musical conversation, is to play more with more people. And I think it's obvious now why I'm uneducated here: it's a skill you develop while socializing. I've hardly jammed with anyone or for any notable lengths of time. These people likely for years would do it everyday for hours. Storytelling only comes in afterwards. I think I'm focused so much on on the bigger picture that I don't even have the small one yet

The goal of being an anchor is being so secure in yourself that you can go anywhere and stay true to yourself. As true in Music as in Life.

Stating to think that the appeal of books is to learn without having to experience failure and embarrassment 

I think one of the reasons I struggle to tell people about my dreams or whatever maybe not tell them about it so much as like create any kind of self affirmation for it is because I don't believe it and I don't have evidence for it. Like I think about the idea of talking to someone that I would want to date and telling them I'm a drummer, or even when I had a conversation with Chandler or when I talk with family about it all, I feel like I'm lying to them half the time. We're looking for like real world evidence that proves what I'm talking about and maybe it's not so much. I'm trying to prove it to them as I am trying to prove it to myself, but what ends up happening most of the time is, I don't falsify evidence, but I complete the value of certain things, like right now I think about telling people that I'm now getting mentorship from a Grammy winning Drummer or light… I don't know. I think there's a distance between something I create and the effect it has for the emotion it creates. Like I think I can create something from a certain emotion but the way it actually comes out. You know the intention for it is very disconnected from that. It seems like. And I think a lot of times that process is just I guess I'm back-and-forth? It's like you try something and you see how it performs and then you improve off of it or you edit it to match the intentions further. In the way this ties back into what I was talking about is like if I'm going in to try and tell people that you know I'm a drummer. It feels like I'm lying half the time and I think for the longest time what I thought was that people were judging me for saying that, but I think now I'm starting to see that it's not that it's that I don't believe that when I say it so there's no way anyone else is gonna believe me because I'm saying it from a place of disbelief which creates an error of disbelief. I think I have to like, feel it and truly believe that I am a professional drummer, not only that I'm a professional book that I'm a drumming, legend and then letting go of any need to have like evidence to validate that or something. Almost seems like a dangerous tool to believe in something even though there's no evidence it's true. But isn't that just faith?

Good first move in any genre is fully internalize the time keeper. For jazz, I think this mean making sure at all times when listening knowing what beat, wha measure, and what part of the firm you're in

What do I need to observe when listening to a song?
- Place in chorus
- Count at all times (body intuition level)
- push or pull

Perception of music is starting to change, becoming more encompassing, more overall energy/emotion, and less about drums

Should really work through all the Haley stuff. Never have realized before how much it's impacting me, but the fact that that (and some stuff with Amy) continues to come up shows me it's still heavy in my mind and body

Starting to envision a future where I can understand people in music. Where, while playing with them, I can sense the flow of conversation and be a part of it. It's obvious to me too that the only way forward is to play with more people more often

Thunder road 

What is it about Mimsa trying to help that bothered me so much?
- So many assumptions about what I'm not doing
- Defensive and prideful about career path
- Afraid to look stupid
- Hate when people help unsolicited
- Advice makes it feel like I'm behind
- Afraid of unrealistic or immoral aspirations
- Don't feel like I'm actually being heard
- Unsolicited advice
- Feel like I need to prove or defend myself
- Significant effort goading for her approval, otherwise risking rejection and ostracism
- Not enough faith in myself to Risk explaining the full story
	- Fear of the egotism?
- Haley plays into it all, but I'm not sure how
- Different and I think conflicting view of aspirations
What is the goal here? I guess get to a point where I'm unphased by unsolicited help? Where I can take the advice to heart without feeling offended by it

Maybe it was a struggle to communicate? It doesn't feel too much different from leaving the jam session. That coupled with some unwillingness to be vulnerable. Like I wanted to explain the grand scheme of my aspirations, but I hardly felt I had room to communicate those things, and even when I did I didn't believe in them enough to not be embarrassed by them.

I want to be revered and world-renowned.
I am.

Maybe that's it? Like I don't respect my beliefs/desires/objectives enough so my saying them is often a way of testing them. I have very little criteria over whose advice/opinions I'd accept, and so rejection from everyone feels harming. Or like any rebuttal is a personal attack on something I can't yet justify.

So like different intentions created miscommunication. My intentions were to I guess garner support?

Why don't I go to a studio, get double what I'm making at SBUX, and keep building my own practice?

I think I'm just mentally conflicted on what the best version of myself would do or have done. I look at people like Larnell Lewis or Seth Godin or Keith Ferrazzi or Stephen King or Jojo Mayer or John Mayer would've done where I am and…they're all known as individuals, but that wasn't the case in their 20's I bet. There's very limited people tha are. And I think that's what makes it hard where I am right now, trying to build my own path as a personal brand, entrepreneur, and artist. I can't even understand my intentions right now, or if this idea isn't just a way of resisting/delaying the hard work. I look at what they've become and it's hard to imagine them working in someone else's business, especially in a way related to their own passions. I feel like so long I've resisted working in someone else's company because it felt inauthentic or like it ran counter to my goals. Ironically, that's what brought me to Starbucks. The idea that it was flexible part time work with benefits that I could gig outside of. I didn't want to overextend myself into music by teaching and practicing out of fear of burnout, but the more I fall in love with Music the less that feels likely. Almost like I had to get used to the performance and the practice and get comfortable with them before I took on more practical related work like teaching. It almost feels like what's made me resist going and working for a lessons company was largely due to ego, resistance to community. Now that I'm unpacking that, it feels like starting my own thing would be lonely in the moment. And I guess that's where I get caught up now. If I started my own thing, I'd have to continue going at it alone. I can't yet afford to have others in the process. I don't know what or whose problems I'd be solving by starting something on my own. And I definitely couldn't do it as well as some of these other companies. It's like…now I see I could make more (in the short term), connect with others, and learn how to teach all while getting a better structure all by just playing a role in someone else's business. And I think that's just what worries me, what if I get it all and lose all my ambition? I could have all these things in my own company too, it's just going to be harder, take longer, and be more isolated at the start.

What if I don't lose my ambition? I gain the structure I want, which will facilitate more growth. I gain the experience that can take me anywhere. I can spend the time in the environment understanding the people I want to help. And I gain connections.

To get the color scheme I'm going for, i have to go out and get a picture somewhere that captures awe and wonder

Being in the right room, the right community, outsources and automates the task of pressure and standards so that you can focus on meeting them when knowing who it's for.
