Is it better to take all ive written and write from scratch? Or categorize and cut down?

I wanted to write a final bit for the article. I'm writing today and that is that I've come to this realization that one of the most important parts of Bamba or any kind of folklore genre comes from the fact that there was no metronomes at a time, there was no way of understanding the difference between like hard set time and like relative time and so the way people kept time was really relative to each other there was also no concept of you know apply to a met like there's your time relativity was based on fitting in a in a group so when other people were playing, it was about having enough space to have this many notes in between it was about making room that way and I think coming from a period where we've had Mets for so long it puts us kind of at a disadvantage for learning this genre of music because or at least it puts me at a disadvantage for learning the music because I'm so used to playing precisely with a metronome that leaning into the way that they relax time is is completely different getting to the groove is not necessarily about playing precisely with a metronome so much as it is understanding like tendencies to move and we've and really just focusing on other things and I kind of got a glimpse of this when I was learning jazz. The idea that you shouldn't listen to yourself as much as you should get to a point where you don't have to listen to yourself at all I think taking a step back and only playing one drum part which is the Bamba Bell rhythm forces me to let go of my part. It makes it much easier to focus on what other people are doing because I'm not having to focus on my entire body. I'm just having to focus on getting the groove right on this one part and when I play along to other kind of Bemba adjacent material, I can zone in on the Shaker rhythm or the con rhythms the Kinto rhythms, Trey, scope, rhythms and stuff like that and I think by doing that it's giving me a better sense of time

I think there's an important level trying to navigate how to use something like ChatGPT effectively here and as much as I don't really appreciate its use case in my creative scenarios. I think there is a way to use it to better ourselves as musicians and so the part I've been trying to ponder without relying exclusively on ChatGPT is, what does it mean to get into groove? What are the kind of practices I need to get better at Bamba and any Afro Cuban, John rum and I do feel like there are insights from ChatGPT that aren't necessarily like from a place of understanding but they're also they're from a place of giving you information that you may not have known and one of the main things that it is brought to my attention is the idea of respect in playing this genre you know back then there was a Drum hierarchy in that you started off as the Bamba Bell until you could understand the nuances of it and then you moved up To some other pattern and then he moved up to Congo's and eventually made your way up to Kinto and the biggest part I'm taking away from this is that I don't understand why and so one of my big practices has been going back and exclusively playing the Bombay bell pattern for 30 minutes straight to kind of give myself the feeling of being in one of these ensembles or something and I feel like even and just doing that a little bit, I've I've earned a deeper respect for the groove and not losing the groove because a lot of times in these rhythms they're not changing the entire time throughout the whole ceremony especially the bell pattern. It says consistent and it's everything else that's changing around it and I think learning to adhere to that and stick completely to it and hear the way that space is played between each note changes a lot of perspective on time and group play and teamwork. And to add to all like the Metronic stuff, you know there was no metronome, and so the only way to play in time was to synchronize yourself with other people and I think it comes from a time. Period. Where people were already in sync within a tribe they were communicating with each other in this way, and I think somewhere along the way we… I lost that and in an effort to get better at it, I've been joining a run club and jazz jam group to try and force myself to connect better with other people or at least get better at learning how to be a part of some kind of inner play.

It's me, she reflects back my holier than thou mentality

# 01-13-2026

Tried it today, staying in groove is deceptively hard. But I think I get it. It's about completely letting go of your part and submitting to Music and Time. Not playing to impress, but communicating as in a stream of consciousness.

There's so much clothes I want to buy right now

Let go of her. Holding onto her beauty is a form of attachment and expectation. It perpetuates this illusion that beauty is scarce and unattainable.

Music by Ted Gioia is game changing. The concept of music everywhere, hearing the songs of the trees or the blades of grass, has opened my eyes to the beauties of the wilderness even more. Even moreso the concept of sex and war (creation and destruction) being the primary topics of music. Makes me feel like I'm writing about the wrong stuff and brings up resistance to writing music because I can't show it to my parents. Or at least feel weird showing it to them

Album of songs from a cross country trip where each one is a different environment. #projects what do I need for this?
- Van (that can house Mu)
- drum/instrument Mic
- preferably at least one other person

Watch the ways "Holier than thou" comes out today. It'll be interesting to see it fully flushed out.

How do I get more in groove?
- Don't try
- Listen frequently to newer and newer music
- Don't abandon the baseline. Set it, play it enough that you can completely let go of it, then free your mind for playing on top of it
- Be the bell player at first. 
- Music hasn't changed all that much from back then. Get into the flow of the music and let changes come exclusively from intention instead of fear or pain
- You have to get to a point where you're not anxious about over or underplaying. Where you're listening to exactly what the audience is listening to. Where you're not reacting to every single thing and are instead contributing exactly your part to the greater whole with intention. Fills or accents then just become a way to add color not a necessity to bring attention to yourself. But it all starts with playing the time keeper until that is second nature, then you can free your mind to receive information.
- not being afraid of playing a small, but vital, role

Good selling point for adults: demonstrating that learning is a lifelong joy sets a great example for kids

I feel like exploring the more spiritual aspect of attuning to wavelengths and tapping into universal knowledge feels so much more authentic and joyful and rewarding than something like ChatGPT. It takes longer, but the answers have actual depth

One of the biggest mindset changes from the past year has been this change. I used to be afraid to change the world because I thought it was an ego thing and didn't want to take the responsibility for doing so. Now I feel like I HAVE to change the world, and I want to work towards doing so responsibly.

Like I'm the one who helps makes things happen now. When we were talking about camping, I'm the one who puts the plans together. Building business, it's me who plans out the path and walks it. There's almost a dual benefit to being the planner that comes in tandem with planning camping trips. It's not about having everything, it's about lean survival to get you to a destination.

I'm saying this all from a point of like...I'm so proud right now. It's like every second I claim back from the dopamine addiction gets put towards actually making progress in the activities and things I want to do. And I want to do it everywhere, reclaiming all the spent resources in other categories of my life and devoting them towards the future. It's so fucking exciting feeling the momentum I'm living in. _the groove_. It makes me feel like even through the stress, I can't trust myself to do and achieve anything. Because more and more, I've been able to complete things in spite of resistance or what I want to do in the moment. And it doesn't have to be lofty, but it has to be true.

It's probably the biggest benefit I've gotten from meditation.

I really love you right now Zach. Thank you for everything. We're at the beginning of an amazing part of our lives. It's all beginning to show.

One final thing is that I've begun seeing more of the reason the bell role is the time keeper. It's about getting to a point of playing that's completely autonomous. You don't even have to think about it. You get so in groove that time doesn't change with your emotions or anything else, you completely fall in line to the cycle and never lose the groove. Other people can then completely rely on you because they also fall into the groove, and it's like being in the middle of this meditative trance where everyone is locked in without a thought

Play the rests with as much force as the notes. True in music and in life, know when to take a break

Predilections and urges are minimal today. Cute girl with cute shoes in the lobby, admired her but haven't felt the need to keep checking. Even last night, seeing the shoe displays did very little. Progress!

Can we make every performance a meditation in that way? Where we exclusively focus on the groove and giving in to time

I feel like getting into groove right now is a heavy focus exercise right now. Lots of concentrated effort. But I feel like it's meant to be a flow state.

So even just like a week and a half and I already feel like my sense of time is starting to change where now I can listen to I guess the stuff I used to listen to like thank you scientist and Dream Theater and I can hear like the time discrepancy mainly just like how much they push time and I can hear back on stuff I was doing before and see just how much I was doing the same thing. And alongside this, I've been… I think, focusing on playing the single part over and over has really made me lean into groove rather than focus on like any kind of virtuality or like soloistic playing it makes more and more sense. Why the bad bell rhythm was given to the beginners and I think it's because it's the role where you don't necessarily have to have the ear to know where you fit a place it's the timekeeping is constant and what matters is that you can kind of do it on auto pilot and let everyone else kind of adjust to you and I mean you still have to be stable with it but I think going into it. I thought you're going to have to put the most stable person on it, but it seems more like you put the person who still has to develop their ear on it? Where is the other parts? It seems more vital that they know how and when to interject different rhythms I think because it is a music where the music itself isn't necessarily the focal point it's like background for singing and dancing it playing something consistently for long periods of time seems to be the most important part

I think the big thing it's changing with my mind is the concept of when and how to use Phil's to enhance music because in the context if you're playing like a Bebe bell pattern, you're not supposed to fill at all you just play the same pattern over and over maybe you'll change it up a little bit but pretty much the whole ceremony is you playing that one over and over cause you're the anchor for everyone else and so now when I've gone back to try and jam with other songs, I find myself more often than not staying away from using any fills and even playing less notes because it feels like it fits into the groove more not only that, but I also feel like there's a much greater emphasis on listening to other people in the music around you when you're having to play this bell powder and over and over again you know you get to a point where you don't have to think about it anymore so it's more important to kind of lose yourself in the Group instead of I've been trying to do this more when I play other music too by playing in a way that is consistent enough that I can lose myself in the groove and really focus on what other people are playing and I find that doing that makes playing a lot more simple and really just more enjoyable. I think the thing I struggled with it still kind of struggled with going into this is the idea that coming from like a virtual stick background or even like a one where I played solar work it feels weird, giving up the agency of fills and solos because there's almost this sphere that you lose yourself in the process or you become obsolete or unimaginative, but I think the farther and I get the more I realize that that's completely not the case like if anything you become more stable and more coordinated and more reliable in the role you're playing and you begin to hear how your accents and your films can complement people or transition things rather than just acting as a way of fiddling around

Walking out of REI there's something so appealing about everything that that place promises. It's probably one of my favorite businesses. In part because it's a member owned and in another part because you go in there and you get the sense of adventure, you know you get this feeling like you could survive anywhere and when I go in, I start thinking and imagining like what life could look like you know a couple years from now and it's full of just like these adventures you know what I've when I look at it. I look at it from like the place that I am now and it's so exciting to think about planning and preparing an adventure that only requires you to have a tent in a bed and the rest is kind of up to you like isn't that just so amazing? You can go anywhere you could do anything like you could backpack for days just having like supplies to carry you through it and I think the games I played growing up that's what I'd liked about them was like you know monster Hunter, going into an area having fully prepared your equipment and you know brought like potions you needed and stuff like that to conquer whatever you're going to conquer it feels that way with REI and going like backpacking and camping. It's like you're taking your life with you and you're facing the elements but like it's not that dangerous of a thing or at least not when you know what you're doing I just get like so fucking excited walking out of there thinking like you know I could get all this camping equipment I could find people who will go on these adventures with me. You know go plan and prepare and then go out for like a weeklong hiking expedition where we bring our own food and we cook our own food on the trail and we walk and we enjoy nature without needing really anything else like it's a reminder of where we've come from like I think you get so used to believing that you need all this superfluous stuff like technology video games are sugar, addictions, or social media or something but it's like the minute. You're out there you're on your own and you realize you don't need any of It.

Looking at that it makes me wonder how I could bake that experience into Rhythmic. You know a place where you have community and you go there and you feel like you could do anything like you could write whatever song you wanted to write you could become famous doing so like I think it's what guitar center was supposed to be, but I never feel like that way going in there I feel like I don't know weird going in there. It's weird because Rhythmic is in a retail place or maybe it could be one day but like I don't know I feel like working on it so much today I got inspired thinking about everything it could be for people that come to it it's like I have to start, but I don't know. I think barking through a lot of it today I started to see like more progress that could be made and I feel like I have a good starting point especially for the website, I have a good starting point I'm not necessarily happy or set on the color scheme because I feel like I've come up with like a better idea of what I wanted to look like, but I like the font and it's hard because like I wanted it to be vibrant, but I wanted to feel like a sunrise, you know the start of a new day and a calm morning like I feel like what I want to embark on people is a feeling of opportunity I guess or a new beginning or something. I think I like what I like about REI if you go in there, it doesn't matter how old you are. It feels like you're ready to go you could start and you can camp and you can do whatever or bike or whatever and it's like how do I get that feeling with this place? Maybe not exactly you know like I looked at all the other websites and I feel like it's a bunch of the same message it's like we have open availability will come to you and we have professionals working here. Maybe I'm naïve, but I don't think that's what people are looking for you know I don't think that's the language. I think people wanna know that they're gonna learn something anyways I don't know. I was thinking about the website and I want to revamp the offer a bit cause I mean right now it's just here's what you're gonna get out of it and here's who I am and I feel like the part that's gonna stand me out. The most is the fact that it's a face in a name like they know who they're getting it's not just interfacing with the company. It's a real person with a real personality and that personality is shown on the website, but I guess I wanna know like I don't know cause I was looking at all of dolls thing and I keep thinking like maybe I should call the Rhythmic community like joining the Rhythmic community but is that deceptive? Is that wrong like I don't know if that's gonna work as well. It's worth like playing around with you AB testing.

I really love you right now Zach. Thank you for everything. We're at the beginning of an amazing part of our lives. It's all beginning to show.

One final thing is that I've begun seeing more of the reason the bell role is the time keeper. It's about getting to a point of playing that's completely autonomous.

Predilections and urges are minimal today. Cute girl with cute shoes in the lobby, admired her but haven't felt the need to keep checking. Even last night, seeing the shoe displays did very little. Progress!

Can we make every performance a meditation in that way? Where we exclusively focus on the groove and giving in to time

I feel like getting into groove right now is a heavy focus exercise right now. Lots of concentrated effort. But I feel like it's meant to be a flow state.

How do I get more in groove?
- Don't try
- Listen frequently to newer and newer music
- Don't abandon the baseline. Set it, play it enough that you can completely let go of it, then free your mind for playing on top of it
- Be the bell player at first. 
- Music hasn't changed all that much from back then. Get into the flow of the music and let changes come exclusively from intention instead of fear or pain
- You have to get to a point where you're not anxious about over or underplaying. Where you're listening to exactly what the audience is listening to. Where you're not reacting to every single thing and are instead contributing exactly your part to the greater whole with intention. Fills or accents then just become a way to add color not a necessity to bring attention to yourself. But it all starts with playing the time keeper until that is second nature, then you can free your mind to receive information.
- not being afraid of playing a small, but vital, role

Good selling point for adults: demonstrating that learning is a lifelong joy sets a great example for kids

I feel like exploring the more spiritual aspect of attuning to wavelengths and tapping into universal knowledge feels so much more authentic and joyful and rewarding than something like ChatGPT. It takes longer, but the answers have actual depth

Being in groove means not anticipating the beat. It means going autopilot, but not unaware. Using energy not to monitor every motion, but only to adjust when you've fallen out of groove

Need to diagnose and work through friendship issues which I think are part of chronic shoulder pain rm. lot of guilt coming up this trip and i think it's around Angelo, Amy, Jess, college friends, and even further back. Beginning to think this is the stuff that's made making friends so hard, harboring this guilt. At the very least, I think it's making the connection feel resisted. Having trouble settling into it and looking for reasons to fight it. Partly attraction but I feel like that's a small role here? Guarded is probably the right word. Come to think of it, I don't think I've really been able to relax into a friendship since Angelo.

Some thoughts today on camping trip:
- afraid of my attraction to both Kevin and Amanda, so struggling being intimate with them. It doesn't seem to be as much as a new behavior as it is awareness with how distant I've always been from them. Both in conversation and physical proximity. Don't want to bring up vulnerable topics because I don't want to bring them closer (under the guise of not wanting to lead them on?) resisting the very connection I'm seeking seems like a tug of war. Or Chinese finger trap 
- Starting to notice the sounds of nature, the music played on any route. Something to take with me on any adventure
-

Wanted to write before I went to bed. Camping right now with Kevin and Amanda. It's...so fucking amazing. I mean for one, our collective madness got us in here at like 10:30 PM and had to break through a gate to get in LOL. But all the way down, I kept having so many huge feelings. I feel like for way too long, I've held onto old friends. People who aren't even in my life anymore, and it's made it hard to connect with these kinds of people. It's so empowering knowing that these people exist though, and that we have this power to do things together. That there are people who genuinely share this kind of interest. Not only that, but to know there are such cheap ways to explore and enjoy the world. Like we don't need more than what's in a car to survive. Some tents, some laughs, and some good music.

We listened to Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Dijon, and many other bands all the way down. Singing along with them too! It feels weird because I feel so happy, but there's some kind of edge to it. Almost looking to spoil it.

But I also kept thinking about how amazing it would be 3-6 years from now, doing this same exact thing but with partners. I kept imagining Her being here with me, and it being this amazing experience. Idk, it's stuck in my head. I love you Mann, get some sleep

Really exhausted, want to explore friend stuff at some point. Can't stop imagining Her right now. Talked with Her earlier, but want to keep doing it. It feels like I only really connect with Her when I have space or rest. Like it always seems the connection is strongest after social stuff or getting away from the routine

Main takeaway from all this is I'm terrified of attracting people to me, I also have some kind of need to make other people follow the rules or believe what I believe, and

Level of insecurities becoming visible. I think I used to worry about how everyone thought of me, but now knowing more about the nature of thought I think it's apparent that's moreso the insecurity speaking

Weird conversation with Amanda last night, ended up pretty dark? Or took me to a dark place. I've been worrying a lot about like getting deep with people again, but when I look at it now it feels like that was a bad thing. I think I'm entering a new version where I don't want to exclusively focus on the negative or get deep with it. Like I want to get really deep with the positive. But I look back in all the ways I've connected and found depth with people before, and it feels like it's a self sacrifice thing? Almost like this tool that encourages others negativity? Idk how to explain it, but I have more words.

Continued question with that today, what is getting groove?

The way I've started seeing objects of clutter is that if I haven't used it in over a year, it's taking up the space and value of something I could be using every day. Not only that, but I'm also holding onto something that someone else may value and use much more than me.

Feel like I need to always have a transition/recovery day after these vacations. Trying to get the flyer and a practice in feels wrong or like over exertion with the exhaustion I currently face. Want to intentionally rest after work and leave it open. Yeah I'll go rest with the cats and if I feel up to it later, getting that flyer done and posted in one location will be my top priority. The man thing I want to figure out with that is a good color scheme

Thinking about what I want to write about this week while sitting in this coffee shop. I've been reading *music: A Subversive History* by Ted Gioia and...WOW. I'm reading this as part of an everlasting pursuit to deepen my relationship with and love for music and WOW. In connection with research on the Bembe, one of the most prominent ideas is tha of an *audience*. In the book, Ted talks about how the concept of an audience, one that separates performer from those observing, is a recent and detached evolution of music. In folkloric music, there was no distance between the two. Gonna brain dump. There was a shamanistic approach and view where music itself was deemed altering. It was a means of combating more dangerous and deadly prey by singing out in unison the song of your people, and after the slaughter it became a way of preserving or celebrating the life of the animal that had given itself to them. In the rituals it was a way of creating unity, synchronizing with the tribe, and honoring the Gods above and I find that so magical and fascinating especially in comparison to how it's approached nowadays where we either idolize an artist on our phones or go to a concert and watch them perform on a stage people going around saying "I don't know how to play music" or "im not a musician" without realizing that to be human is to be a musician in the tribal times music was how we survived how we got on the same page it was synchronization it was how we fought prey and scared of predators by joining our voice in unity and it's been reduced to profit by people who don't respect the culture of where it's come from what it's capable of but I see more and more with Bembe when I play it and collect others to play it with me why it's so powerful why the groove is necessary because in playing the rhythm over and over again even by yourself you sink into it it feels heavier and you are able to lose yourself in it you get to a point where you don't have to think about it you relax and you play and you only gain awareness again when you slip out when you fall away having played this for over an hour a day even passively on a camping trip I've been on so I've been on this camping trip with my friends and instead of neglecting my studies my life has grown in a way where I feel inspired to continue growing so frequently as we adventured through different forests beaches swamps and other terrains I found myself asking "what is the song of this area?" The book I've been talking about has completely expanded my definition of music and song beyond the 4-piece ensembles and entertainment-exclusive perception I've had for it up until now. I walked through each ecosystem trying to identify the plant life and animal like by the sounds they made and although I'd always been into mediation, I'd never before experienced a deepening of appreciation for the world we'd lived in quite like this. In Continuation of the Lesson I learned about the unity of the frogs croaking to ward off prey but from the concepts in Ted's book it also seems like the unity of songs from human could be used as powerfully as a weapon, scaring off lions and other predators and stealing away their kills. But everywhere I went, I found myself sinking into the Bembe bell rhythm. I'd play on the railings of boardwalks, the console of the car we'd rode around in, and finally by the fireside where me and one of my friends played the bell pattern and shekere rhythm with each other. Even now I feel the pulse moving through my mind trying to find a place to get out. It's through doing this and relaxing into this that I feel like I finally understand being in groove. Not only with the music, but in the sense of being in unity. Listening. Being in groove is a respectful thing it's about recognizing and appreciating the rolls of other members in an ensemble or present tribe and appreciating each members part while playing your own. The bell player is the time keeper because they haven't yet developed the capacity to hear the changes and to respect the sanctity of the ritual, and it seems until you can fully play the part on autopilot and stay in groove, it's until you...you're not promoted until you have the capacity to recognize your role and to continue fully contributing to that role. The shamanic powers only come about through holding the synchronization which can only happen when no forces try to dominate, no forces try to impress, and everyone works together to support the ensemble. It's through cooperation that we thrive.

And it all makes me look back on my past. The other thing I know now that I struggled with is performativeness. I think I somewhat struggle socially now because I'm at the tipping point between who I was and who I want to be. I've been hyper aware during social events because my old response was to gut out drama, to search for people's darkness almost as a way of feeling better than them. To be their therapist. I felt that's what deep connection was. But now, I want something different. I want those deep connections, but from a place of joy and comfort and happiness and unity. And I think I got so used to uncovering darkness tha now I'm having a difficult time figuring out how to move in the opposite direction. I think it brings out that whole attraction issue because it's like vulnerable, it's different, it's not who I used to be, I don't want it to be fake but it feels fake. I also don't want to lead anyone on AND I'm terrified of being in a relationship. Crazy layingit all out like that. There's something else I can't remember. OHH the other aspect of it is like trying to manage other peoples emotions?  Used to think it was empathy, but now I usually just feel like it's a self defense thing. Not just managing emotions, but really any form of protecting people from
The consequences of their actions and/or molding them to my rules

Really want to get to a point where I'm not constantly thinking about food

Another thing I've started to realize in playing the Bemba rhythm is the idea of the flexibility of time I think when you're so constrained to like metronomic time it's easy to get caught up in the idea of like a quarter note pulse being exactly where it is every time and trying to line up with that, but I think in the idea of cyclical time there's a strong blend between the quarter notes in the triplet notes. I think what I mean by this is going into it I had the impression that all the double notes or the double plays in the 68 pattern were the only parts of time being stretched like if you were playing all of the clave pattern in end of itself at that time remain fixed to like metronomic time, whereas the kind of transfer between the two that happens in the diddle that's the only part of time that gets stretched you know brought forward or backwards, but I think the more I play it the more I realize that there's there's like an interpolation between the 6/8 pattern and the four or four pattern, where the only consistent thing is the cycle and everything else that rely that lies in between repetitions of the cycle can be stretched, however, needs to be necessary. The only thing is that it should remain consistent with time, but it can go in between every note being played exactly with like what a metronome would play, and every note being Played almost with little fluctuation, it gets interpreted between every note being played completely metronome and on the other side, every note getting complete plate completely in the same amount of space

I think one other aspect of this is looking at the ways in my life has been so far shaped and away that has been outside of any kind of rhythm. For about two years now, I've also struggled to like get into any kind of flow or Rhythmic state or any kind of consistency and structure because my scheduling has been unpredictable for work and so I've used that as an excuse not to develop any kind of structured to the life I was living. I think I felt like because I was flexible with work. I had to be un flexible in the way that I… I think I felt because I needed flexibility from work. I couldn't expect to develop any kind of structure around it and so I think in getting better at learning how this bell pattern incorporates to the rhythms of the world and also to the consistency of like the ceremonies and how they're developed to help me in my own life to understand how to build a more consistent structure that I could rely on you know things like attending jam sessions, and run clubs… Building space in them every week that I could rely on showing up to these things and being able to socialize with the same people all the time. It's not it's not something I felt like I could really understand before and it's funny how it evolves from just sitting around playing a rhythm for 45 minutes straight and understanding, what kind of cultural context has evolved from that?

I GOT INVITED TO A FRIENDS BIRTHDAY PARTY!! It's for Caleb Heiple. Part of me thinks this shouldn't be as big a deal as it is, but I just love that a friend has included me in their plans. It feels so gratifying 

I want the colors to indicate playing a grudge Catalina club during the sunrise on top of the mountain. The calm morning before an adventure. Maps to emotions: grounded, curious, excited, and trustworthy

Make the page almost like a height map, with colors increasing in intensity.
