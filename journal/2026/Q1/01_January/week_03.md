Need reflective gear and headlamp to do morning runs again. It's too risky and weird doing it otherwise

Woke up this morning feeling like crap, almost sickly. When I look back on what I ate/drank yesterday it made sense. Lackluster energy from potato chips, 3 chocolates, streusel bar, microwave chili lunch with a lot of bread, and a protein bar. Top it off with a breakfast of coffee. Of course I felt awful! Been drowning myself in water this morning, and need to eat well to prepare for today's run. It occurs me I can stop thinking about food if I make a routine of it

Starting to have a full body clarity after chugging so much water. Can actually sense the hunger 

Being heavy, being an anchor, is about knowing your place. Letting everyone else play around you but staying consistent. THATS the important part of being in groove. Being reliable and trustworthy so that others can color time how they see fit. They need that stable ground to work off of

Need a different approach for blog posts. Editing takes at least two hours, and need a buffer period for it to not feel rushed. Probably post Wednesdays? I'll post a small one today. Can do a bigger one next week.

What am I actually stressed about?
- Trying to fit it all in
- Working hard today in spite of today's exhaustion 
Tbf exhaustion is partially from drinking caffeine after 1 + 17k. Need to moving forward have rest days the day after long runs. Bread this early might also be a bad thing. Should move blogs to Tuesday as well since Mondays are going to be predominantly running days now on
- Realizing that to reach my business goals, I'll have to (for a couple of months) put my own practice on the back burner. Not willing to drop below 1hr/day but it sucks thinking I won't be striving for 3 for some time. Then trusting I'll get right back on afterwards

Maybe caffeine suppresses exhaustion

Wonder. The emotion is wonder.

Desire plummeted. Possibly exhaustion, but last night even the old stuff wasn't potent enough to get me far. Let go of it pretty easily too.

Definitely resisting connection with Kevin and Amanda. Something more intimate rooted in avoidance, tantamount to what I used to feel with Brandi.

Developing a more keen sense for burnout/energy problems. Last night I really struggled and had to force myself out of work mode, realizing that what I was working on (color scheme) wouldn't get any better continuing the way I was. Needed distance. But there's also the world signals like clutter, clothes thrown everywhere, struggling to maintain baseline.

Need to succumb to it after work honestly. Let it take how long it needs to take then reorganize. Hate how much practice I'm missing right now, but I gotta slow down again

Shifting my schedule around so I have 3+ hours of break after work. Intentional rest! Can shorten if need be but really want to make sure I get enough in there.

Success/fame/whatever you want to call it is just the progressive expansion to the number of people you can help.

When I get out of groove of the rest of life (burnout) I stop wanting to be in groove in drumming. They're parallel. A lesson to be learned. I noticed this yesterday when I played along to some songs, had no desire to connect with the music, only fiddle around on top of it. 

Also have been noticing that being that anchor, the heavy groove, comes from feeling it no matter what. Being steady enough that people feel they can play anything with you there. Was thinking about this a lot when hearing the drum solo to Gravity with Larnell Lewis. I love his part But I thought so much more about the bass and piano parts, which stayed stable no matter what he played and let him bend in and out of time around them. It's made me think about how embarrassing it would be to be able to solo, but not play that stable anchor part that those two played. I think getting in groove is really being able to hear others parts without letting it phase you. It's made me want to practice more of this feeling, remaining unchanged even when everything around you changes. Good way to practice this would just be clapping along to either the quarter pulse or the fundamental rhythm and hold h that the whole song

Been brainstorming with how to manage teaching time effectively. Here's what I have:
- Need to (quickly) find a way to automate advertising. These posters should be good at first but if I can hire someone for this it would be great
- Set aside specific days for lessons (probably by their availability, but most likely weekdays) and leave 2-3 days free for weekend. Ie MAKE SURE TIME OFF IS IN

How do I get over the money hungry projection? It's not real but it's a huge insecurity 

I think I have to learn to enjoy live music. 

Funny how much I tie beauty to talk ability. Couldn't talk to anyone around but there's a more awkward looking fella next to me now but I feel like could easily talk to him

Nex version:
- Scan Here -> Sign Up Now
- Faded background kinda looks like piss

Sitting down and clarifying the roles of marketing and sales is really going to help moving forward. 

It also occurs to me that sales calls are going to be a fairly frequent thing. Like sales and marketing are wrapped under this whole project and having a project management position is going to make that more clear. Right now the teaching position is fairly dormant.

Thing is, from a management and project level, I'm actually really excited to approach the strategic parts of this. And I think if I take the mindful approach--sitting in a coffee shop and listening for answers--I can make this work. But I think one of the first steps is clarifying this first project. But I think writing out the project requirements and assigning roles is going to make it more clear what needs to be done, and what it means for this project to be complete.

I feel like what I need isn't as much to pick a color scheme as much as hiring someone to get to know me and pick one that represents the experience they get around me. Create a design scheme based on actual experience 

Critiques from Brandi and Russ
- Energetic feeling from the orange
- Gray is a bit dull
- Color change for different headers seems off
- needs more images

I don't feel as obsessively drawn to women/footwear as I used to be. Walking around Whole Foods, there's plenty of beauty. But I have a much easier time letting it move, watching her come and go without following. It's a pleasant change

Better way to handle blog might be to just take Austin Kleon's example. Doesn't need to be big, just ten things from the week

I just want to know when She’s going to show up now. I feel impatient and like…I’m putting in all this work for a better life. It feels like I’m stuck in the interim. I’m enjoying it, but it feels like better is on the horizon. It feels so close that I can almost taste it. The inner security is growing stronger. The foundation is forming. It’s all coming into place, but it feels like I’m half an inch from the results and that next push feels the hardest. Not in that I can’t do it, but in that I don’t have control over it. It feels like I’m setting in place the motions and habits which will get me so much closer to where I want to be, and I finally have the discipline to see them through. It’s just hard to believe the answer now could be as simple as just showing up each time and getting a little better each time. Like I feel it every time I go to a run club or jazz jam, that each time I’m getting a little closer. I feel like I’m connecting so much more with everyone and like I’m starting to finally show up as the person I want to be and connecting with people in the way I’ve always wanted to and feeling enough inner security to be myself everywhere. The hard part is just knowing that everything I want feels on the cusp and I’m just edging until I get there

It’s a fantasy that makes me want to explore more. Like I think consciously I know She is just a reflection of my highest Self. But it’s really rewarding finally having this dream bc and inner connection that rewards presence and doesn’t erase me. This feeling of having someone who looks at me with a wide smile and glistening eyes. I even had a fantasy last night where we were sitting together and she was upset, but I could internalize the fact that that didn’t threaten our relationship. I let her have her time and she grew closer to me because of it. It’s like…I feel like all these fantasies are this deep realization, at a nervous system level, that I can be secure in a relationship. It’s like they’re playing in my mind to create the habits which will manifest into that exact kind of relationship or connection with everyone. And I think it’s making me more secure in all my relationships because I’m no longer feeling like I’ll be harmed if other people abandon me. And it’s like…almost like for the longest time I’d misinterpreted connection as something that I always had to sacrifice myself to get to. But now it feels like getting to that deep level of vulnerability doesn’t require pain. I can show up and be a good listener without being a martyr. I feel really proud right now and happy. Like I’m learning how to relax, how to enjoy life, how to meditate longer, how to live, how to love, and it all feels like it keeps coming back around. And now I’m just like…I’m so excited to meet Her. To be with Her and a part of Her. I would do whatever it takes to get there sooner, and every fantasy (although it makes it really hard to resist masturbating at times) feels like it deepens whatever recalibration is happening and makes me feel like I could do anything

I think it all ties directly into what I’m learning with music. It’s about getting into groove, seeing the emotion and getting lost in it. Stopping listening to myself and paying attention to myself and instead focusing on other people’s parts. Getting into flow with them. Something about that action and practice has changed everything

I'm starting to notice more of what it means to like fall and groove with something. Like I guess starting off with music I see more often how easy it is to just lose yourself into it by letting go of what you're doing and listening to like other parts specifically or the group as a whole seeing how you felt in mine and it makes me feel like before what I was doing was, I was trying to create time instead of falling in mind that and I'm not exactly profession at this yet night at the very least absurd to see it how especially in this folklore music, you can just kind of fall into the cycle and be a part of it, and I think when each person's part contributes to hole falling into the cycle is no different than being like a year in the machine played by music herself. And I think the way that this plays into like the grand scheme of things is approaching all listening this way has let me connect with people better you know like when people are talking or I'm in a room with other people instead of focusing on my part and the way that I talk I focus on what other people are saying more and how the kind of group dynamic of conversation contributes to conversation and it's kind of a fascinating realization because I feel like my friendships are growing because of it too. It almost feels like I used to approach music and people with this sort of fear you know, constantly watching myself and trying to adjusted make sure that I was fitting in or playing the right part and it's weird that the solution all along was just to not listen to my part to just you know, understand the role of the time, keeper and then fully like relax into that role and then add color and substance where needed. I still don't know when the right times to add things like supplementary roles or substance in color or completely necessary, but I feel like that's kind of like the next step on this journey.

but doing that. Also makes me just like feel better in general you know less foggy and it's almost like to keep up with a pace of running I have to make sure that I'm relaxing into the structure of a good diet.

Cooking is a LOT more fun when prep and cook are separated. Much less stress and more just following instructions

I fucking hate having to explain what I do to people like Chandler it always makes me feel so insecure and second guessing...idk. I feel like when I think about it, the people who I WANT in my life already get it and support it. The only people that seem to question it are people who have no idea what they're doing. (Chandler and Zoe). Obviously some kind of projection of their values and insecurity and needing to put a label on anything. I just hate the way they propose a career track out of it.

I think I just hate it because it puts pressure on me to try and explain the scope of what I'm doing to people who would never understand without the context of my life and my role models.

Why have you been running around all day?

I think I'm just stuck in a habit loop. I use wor to be over the anxiety. I hate being confronted about the fact that I don't know what I'm doing because it makes me actually have to confront the small things I'm doing that aren't contributing anything. It feels like I'm running and I can't stop. I can't slow down. I have to let it burn out. Like if I'm running down a hill, I'd be giving up, falling down, and crashing out. 

I think also having them here reflects back that I'm not the host I wish I was. I could've gotten plenty of food and water to all of us, but I didn't Want to afford it. Could've cooked for them and I didn't. Entertained them too. 

The element of connection here makes me so uncomfortable. And the leadership involved. Like I think about how at all the parties I go to, someone else is in charge. So I can just sink into the community. With these guys, and with a lot of people now, it's like challenging my inner security to exist around others and still stay true to myself. It feels like I'm having to re-learn how to socialize. And even sit in a room with other people. Like I'm having to learn how to have a sense of security not affirmed or created by anyone else. And I think that's the core thing I'm struggling with when going to all these new community events, being around Joes friends, or even family. And I think it's something I've struggled with for a long time and really explains a lot of my detachment. I've always sank into myself, into fantasy, to escape discomfort around people. In a lot of ways, it's good I'm developing this now. I can already tell it's helping in so many ways to make me more courageous my it's just difficult in the meantime.

I didn't get nearly as much drumming in last week and it sucks. I'm itching to practice but feel like I need to rest
