Community drum circles
- Double up parts
- BYOD, a couple provided
- Really easy way to generate community once a week, make it free? At least at first

Writing takes on a whole new meaning rn, I feel like I can genuinely feel the emotion. I think what's stopped me for so long is the mechanical mindset of having been a programmer. Detailing every little action out is complicated, but writing to visualize and feel changes a lot. Almost like what's birthed from the outlet of dopamine addiction is an ability to enjoy emotiom

Pursue it because you love it. Because you can't breathe without it. 

I think I struggle, in open loops, with distinguishing between debt loops and yield loops. Like everything cluttering the basement is taxing my mind, same with my car problems, same with my bed, and same with appointments. But what of these are genuine priorities versus upgrades?

How do they describe someone they admire?

What I'm getting towards now is participation in mindful entertainment. Movies and books. Listening to music for hours at a time and doing nothing else. A desire to participate in Music in a way that I get lost in it

Would be really cool to get a Bembe set up where right foot was hooked up to clave, freeing hands for the conga lines

How do we imitate the Shekere rhythm on drums? That's a big challenge, because it's not exactly 16th notes

Things bogging my mind:
- Anxiety around teaching Jalen
- Mom commenting on dishes in the sink before I'm done eating
	- At a deeper level, pattern of her interrupting my calm with her anxiety and feeling obligated to do what she asks
- Tire issue
- doctors dentist eye and vet appointments, associated costs
	- Is there any for eye? Or even for Doctor? Dentist probably
- Finishing out planning
- Anxiety around dilligence towards scheduling breaks
- Poor sleeping recently
	- Bed issues, not relaxing in time
- Impending time sinks (lessons)
- impending insurance payment
- Setting forth a lot of goals I actually have to live up to which are taking me outside my comfort zone
- Meeting deadlines
- Finding time for everything
- needing rest
- Wanting to plan a me trip but not being able to afford it
- Not believing in the short term (3 months and less) future I've set out for myself.
- Declittering spaces and tasks

I think it boils down to
- Expected costs putting pressure on my lifestyle without even having started to grow it, fogging my peace of mind
- Poor diligence towards rest routine, both at night and in scheduling. Planning before bed exacerbates this
- short term task overload, not trusting structure. Also feels like too many days dedicated to planning? 
	- No simple way of viewing week overview 

I think it's all indecision in one way or another.

Am I napping because I need a nap or because I'm procrastinating?

I am resting until 2:30 OR heart returns to normal

Horniness feels present but muted right now. I think it's the burnout combined with withdrawals.

It feels like the absence of social media and video games shines this major light on my ability to relax and find comfort in calm. Because I don't feel boredom right now. I feel empty and exhausted. My heart is returning to normal and I'm breathing well again, but the thought of returning to reality feels daunting and impossible.

One of the largest things I've noticed in the combination of all of this is an over-reliance on social media / porn, and focus on those places, for access to attractive women. Having their photos readily available at the touch of a button makes it so easy to be "self-reliant" because you never have to be with anyone to have this constant source of "affection" and beauty around. Especially with an imaginative brain, I didn't need anyone. The positivity in my imagination was so much stronger enough that relationships felt lackluster, disappointing, and often times completely negative in comparison. But when you don't have those immediate responses to lean on, you actually have to go outside your house to find it. It's something that keeps coming back to mind today: when I was at the run club, every woman I saw on the beltline was my type. Every guy I talked to is someone I felt inspired by. Social media and masturbation made these things feel impossible before hand because there was an easier way: sitting and watching someone else do it. Going to her profile and looking at the same photos I'd seen a million times, imagining the life we could live if we fell in love in person. I could deal with loneliness by seeing her picture and deluding myself into thinking I was accomplishing things by watching him do it. Without those, I find myself leaving the house more. Walking stores or going places, and actually attempting to be around people I want to be like. When I'm not constantly afraid of seeing it on social media, I feel more courageous

How do we approach rest with discipline and mindfulness? Without forcing it? Physiological symptoms? Main problem is I don't at all believe in it. I understand it logically but there's so much pain and trauma around rest, especially never having intentionally experienced it that the idea makes me more uncomfortable than burnout
- One way is just to become more aware of symptoms and signs of burnout/fatigue

Las night was a really fucking hard one. Spent probably two hours fighting off urges and it fucking sucks because I'm trying to rest from this burnout and get more sleep so I went to bed early enough but I just ended up tossing, turning, and trying not to succumb. I made it! But now I'm exhausted, irritated, and stressed tf out because it's a week into the new year and instead of fighting towards my goals I'm fighting burnout and fighting the urge to masturbate. I know I need to think of this as still fighting towards my goals but sometimes it's hard to see the relevance 

https://open.spotify.com/track/4d6ZgFLhTJ6FqBycD81p38?si=PzU3drZkT-6WwpHQe4VQ-A Good one for HH Bembe

Burnout is not as bad anymore, def still feel it in my back but breathing is better. Noticeable physical exhaustion? Like I'm getting sick. Minor headache.

Imagining, staring at, or really indulging women's feet/shoes in any fashion has become an emotional detriment at this point. It makes me feel like a creep and it worsens the urge to masturbate. Especially if the idea is to quit altogether, the obsession has no place in my new life

Still focus on recovery today. Can meditate on Jalen's thing throughout the day just to get it over with. Light exercise at best.

Where do I want to take Jalen from here? Continue emphasizing the daily practice. Combining stickings. Make sure and ask how difficult it is. Also when making these vids, do low fidelity rn. Invest in quality later, better to just get them out and test them right now

Getting fancy with videos right now is a moot point because I have no idea what works and wha don't. Need to just make it quick and adjust. Use them as experiments, but make them deeply personal. That's how to make it work

Living without the distractions, without the numbing, is really fucking hard right now. I feel so anxious and so

# 01-08-2026

Experiencing another flatline today. I think when I'm not burnt out, withdrawals are easier to manage. One takeaway I got from yesterday is that it doesn't take that long to rest. Or at least, I underestimate how even a little rest can help. Even with just Tuesday off, I was back to pushing myself yesterday. Learning to trust is part of the process, and I want to begging ot understand how long rest is needed to recover. Really just want to rid myself of the illusion that momentum means solely pushing.

Best way to do drum blog is either write observations frequently or SOC for 1000 (estimate number) words a day and edit together something cohesive on mondays? Or talk it out too

A lot of creation is SOC, trust, and learning how to work with those. Too many people try to make
It a conscious process, but it's meant to be done unconsciously and using conscious energy as an adaptive tool. Like you have to let go of trying to control it, create constantly, allow it to flow, and observe it. Let the feedback guide you in the future. That's how you grow and create more constantly. I think this is what people mean by getting in the groove and listening. I realized this the past couple days when playing guitar. I knew how to shred or play licks, but once I just hit a random note I had little idea of where to go, how to not lose the groove with it. Same with drums, it seems I don't listen enough to my own playing because it devolves into noodling, but I'm starting to learn that it's possible to feel it as much when you play it as when listening to others, and true growth happens from that place. From getting into a groove and not losing it. Letting the fingers move where they want to go and adapting from there. This can be done within a structure. 

What are the tools that make this possible?

Need to get LEAN. Cutting out all the food and items in my life that don't matter or don't contribute to the greater path.

Just don't engage with her. Create the boundary and adhere to it. She's just a thorn trying to create controversy. The obsessive part comes from giving too much attention to it, feeding it with your attention. The sooner you let go, the better you'll feel. Come back to center :D

"Now," he continued, "this is real serious stuff. You can treat it like a game when you are just beginning, but even then, your intent must be pure. Once you are confident with your abilities, the power increases. At that time, how you use it has a tremendous effect on all Life everywhere. Right now, you can treat it like a game, but know it is not one."

It's interesting in the ways I've noticed this.

Insights on the way (name of blog)

I shoulda stopped by and hung out with those people in the run club post run. Feel guilty. Lesson for next time 

What do you want me to do right now?

Options are either go home or go up and hang with ARC, but if I'm totally honest my main motivator here is just to watch women on the belt line. I feel like I'm being more social, the best thing is to do the opposite of what I'd normally do (go home). My resistance is I'm totally drained mentally and socially. I feel like I made a lot of mistakes today that I'm willing to learn from.

In total honesty, I feel embarrassed and exposed. And the main question is, is this enough for today or should I try for more?

I also kinda feel rejected by two people I didn't even talk to. Both could be Her (at least physically) and I feel like I've failed trying to communicate with them. 

I DID IT! It was uneventful and I talked to the wrong people and fumbled throughout, BUT I DID IT!

The most energizing part of runners is the people. They're all so generous, so rewarding. There's this common understanding that we are choosing suffering in a way that will bring us joy. Doing it together makes it easier. Like when I went up, it turns out there was a different run club set up and they were just as eager to share as if I was in their club. They greeted me with enthusiasm and congratulated me on finishing. 

I met and talked to more persistent members this week. Was still socially out of it, but had good conversations with Spencer (Teaches adults with disabilities) and Danny (potential trail runner). The practice I've been getting into has mainly been about initiating conversations with strangers. It's daunting and uncomfortable right now, but I'm really proud of you for doing it. It feels like it's getting easier. I need to do more social things that get me out of this comfort zone, where I have to talk to and meet new people. Mastering the practice of making new friends and networking, it's something that I feel is such a logical extension from the work last year. Doing so today feels like, even with just 3 people, a stretch. But I feel like that's part of what it takes to walk into any room and feel like yourself. Two things i also noticed today:
- I talked with and surrounded myself with people who look like me. I think that's a matter of comfort, especially in growing more social, but I think moving forward I need to make an effort to talk to the people who are living in the shape I want to live in. They carry a completely different energy, and I feel like I have a lot more to learn from them than I do people who look/act like me. Even when I feel out of place amongst them, it's the challenge I need.
- That naturally extends to talking with women. I feel like the same resistance that presented itself when thinking about talking with the adept runners came up when thinking about talking to the women I was attracted to there. Yet, as I opened up with more people, it felt easier and easier to imagine a future where I could communicate with them easily. 
In all cases right now, socializing feels tantamount to jumping in a cold shower. There's much resistance to the start and when I get in I'm trying to get out. The more distant they are from how I look (whether that be because they're a woman or incredibly fit) the colder the water feels. My goal isn't to make the water warm, but to find more ways to enjoy it.

In other words, the goal is to create a sense of belonging no matter where I go and who I talk to. I naturally feel more confident around my herd

Something I thought a lot about on my ride home: I think I need to start doing a weekly overview. In creating better structure, I'm starting to get comfortable with the stability, and I think the way to level that up is to, during each review, get an overview of the week where I can start seeing at a glance what the week is to look like. Laid out:
- Look at the week. Understand things like when work is, social experiences, etc. get a good understanding of things like obstacles and where breaks need to go
- When doing this, it would be good to approach more with intention. Plan meals, purchases even, make it a point to try and also understand where tasks can be order on. Makes it so energy is spent on abstaining on the bad rather than deciding on ambiguity.
- Make a point to develop understanding and intentions during this time so that throughout the week, energy is taken away from decision making and put completely into fulfillment
I already find myself happier this way. It makes me more resilient to obstacles. In the long term, with things like budgeting, it'll also make it easier to stick to a plan.

Also, the more practice I can get socializing with strangers, the more open I can be day to day. Could see myself being someone who sits down at a coffee shop and immediately has a conversation with whoever is next to him. Creates so many more opportunities tha way, not to mention meaningful connections

The more I get away from the internet, the more I see how harmful it can be. We need to have unanswerable questions because we need to have a system for finding answers. We have to develop the tool of exploring curiosity. I notice this with Bembe, where every time i have a question, i try to go to chatgpt. But more pften now i realize i need to be trying to find these answers on my own, because tha doesn't teach understanding. It makes you have to do more research, but it also teaches you to trust your ow decision making and resilience to consequential decisions.

# 01-11-2026

So every year, This is for a um, a blog post. On, um, ending. So every year I journey into a new genre of music for drumming. Um, and part of developing a synoptical knowledge of different genres. Something I learned from how to read a book. This year I wanted to cover Bende. For this year, I wanted to cover after keeping drumming. And so I'm starting out with Bambay. Full disclosure I started last year, learning a bit about this stuff. And doing research, I found these videos of, I'm sure they're not, uh, traditional bed bag ceremonies. They're more just dancing ceremonies. But they are traditional African ceremonies, and there's something. Inspiring, awesome. We're in this world where. Sometimes it seems like we're driven further and further apart. There's still this connectivity, you know, these people, they come out, into the streets, for song and dance. And they're somehow able to bring a light to music with just drums. And then singing and dancing. And the vocals end up being some of the most beautiful locals I've ever heard. And I wanted to show you guys this or I wanted to show you this because. I haven't seen it in many places. It goes back to this idea of simple patterns. You know, something that Frank Wiener says in his book. about after keeping drumming is that all African drumming is in some form 68. Meaning that everything inspired from. That Aphrodisporic drumming. Has come from 68 including anything you hear in the US. And I still don't really quite understand what that means. But I do with Benbe, and um. Yeah, but going back to the simple powders, it's interesting seeing how worlds of music have been inspired by Esklave pattern. that 1st appears in these ceremonies. How are the, um, the cowbell pattern. simplified into a closet. And then with her throughout all the time.

One of the 1st things you might notice when investigating Afro-Cuban or any really aphrodisporic. Music. Is the lack of any, like... Basically, what I'm trying to say is, notice that the shake array plays weird six tooth notes. It's not strictly on the beat, but it's... Like, there's a little bit of delay on one of the notes. I haven't quite figured out which one it is yet but... Everything they do, everything that's come from drones, from them. Somehow imitates, like, the physics of the instruments that they were based on.

It's gorgeous outside right now. I can hear the birds chirping. It's like 6:30 a.m. I just got halfway through a run, had to quit. 'Cause I was unprepared. Definitely don't feel like I have enough water in me. And then I ate pretty poorly last night, and I didn't really, you know, eat a banana or anything to get the day started. I think living at Nana's is good for me, for a couple weeks, because it kind of begins to shine holes in places that I was able to get away with at home. You know, for one. All the food is reliant on me. So, whereas before, I was able to get away with snacking on things, it'll be nice to, I think, be bathed in this challenge. where I have full control over what I'm eating. But I think it means they need to be more diligent about, like, you know, picking up bananas and stuff. Um. What else? And I also need uh, some kind of water vest. Or something because, like, can't keep going on these runs dehydrated. Because it's not the 1st one this week. Like the runs are getting harder, but not because I think they're getting more difficult. I think it's just because I'm not preparing for them well enough. And I think the thing that keeps coming to mind now. That, in order to achieve my goals, a lot of times it's not just about taking on that new thing, it's about what am I willing to give up to get there. And a lot of times it's just becoming willing to do whatever that thing is. You know, in the context of running, it's like, am I willing to give up junk food. in the context of a relationship. It's kind of like, am I willing to give up masturbation, and stuff like that. On the other side of it, though, like, I don't know, all these things, I don't, I don't necessarily see is a bad thing anymore. It's like, it's like a challenge. You know, it's no different from living somewhere else. Or practicing a different genre of music. It's like, all of a sudden, you're thrown into new territory. And that's where everything changes. It's like, that's where you become a more consistent version of yourself and kind of round out in ways. And, like, with the whole thing, with quitting social media and masturbation, you know, I keep talking about it, but there's this whole, um, Movement, I guess, like inward movement towards real connection where I'm not, like, necessarily afraid of attraction anymore. In fact, I like lean into it. Whereas before, I think having social media is a crutch, because when I couldn't do anything about it in real life, I could just go there, and look at whatever I wanted, and somewhere it was on the internet, especially when AI started becoming part of the conversation, like, you really could just make anything you wanted to see. Pinterest was, like, really dangerous for me. And I think it makes you delusional. Makes you think, like, oh, this is what all of them look like, and then it just makes all of them look bad. People, I mean. Whereas now, it's like... There's this poll to go places and beat around people. Anyway.

The fascinating part of Bembe, to me, is seeing it as this kind of original root of everything that's kind of been inspired in Cuba, you know, not for keeping it based on, like, the rhythms of the Yoruba tribes. And the clava itself just kind of came from the... dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. So seeing how that's evolved over time into, not only different subgenres of music, but... Mike. How it's inspired. So much music, especially a jazz fusion, is crazy. I don't remember what I was gonna go with this. I keep having this thought, this idea that I need to, like, talk through, and... get ready for the blog, so I can never remember what it is.

It may just be because I don't really know anything about the time period. But one of the most fascinating parts about listening to something like Sunday music, is that... No one person, no single part stands out. Well, it seems like there might be roles to differentiate between. The melody. And the power of this song all come as a result of like communal playing. No one part really takes the spotlight. And I think it makes sense. If that music is coming from a place where people had to rely on each other, where people in these tribes, no person stood out as an individual, everyone was part of a community and played a bigger role in. The growth in the survival of that community. I think in that sense, Music has changed. towards individualism. And I think virtualosity came about. when people started being able to become and survive as individual work. Maybe not necessarily, like, survive as individuals, but believe that they could survive as an individual. Or something like that. And it's something I notice more and more. As I get older, especially in the time we live in. Where, we have a culture, that kind of promotes, Isolation. And being an individual. And I noticed this in my own plane, too, where I felt there was a glamour. To being an individual. Which made some of the listening to this music at 1st really foreign to me because I couldn't figure out where the solos were. Or, where... Like the melody lines were. You know, I was so fixated on looking for a moving part. And it's not that there aren't any. But I was so fixated on looking for some kind of moving part. that at first, I missed the point of it entirely. And that there is no... really moving parts. It just... The purpose of the music is to... be a part of something. in the middle of it. And part of the foundation of it. And I think in starting to understand that better, I can take that everywhere I go, where it's not just about playing well, but playing the part that is invisible. yet means the most. And I realize I still have a lot to learn. And there must be some kind of reason why, you know, people just starting to play in these ceremonies, we're always just given the cowbell roll, or the Benbe Bell roll. And it's something I want to gain insight from. But it makes me wonder if we'll ever be able to have that level of understanding of the music. When our culture is constantly pushing us towards... Being an individual. and trying to emphasize I don't know, 'cause I think about, like, specifically things like ChatGPT and social media. It's like there was a time, before these things where, everything had to be done by someone else, and you had to communicate with people. You had to talk with people. But the thing is, everything you did was part of community. And nowadays, it just feels like... everything you do, you just ask a machine to do for you. And it gets to a point where... you're not even talking to people. You're just... asking a computer to do your work for you. And then. You hop on social media and you talk to... Essentially, your phone all day. Watching other people do things. It's isolating. And I'm kind of getting off topic, and I don't really care anymore.

A couple more insights from running today. One... It takes... I'm trying to be social. A little bit every time. Two... The wig that I prepare for a long run. It's the way that most of these people prepare for every day. Or at least going in with the intention to do your own practice... That's the wrong thing. To the runner. Even running is an opportunity to talk and to connect. That's about letting go. You intended it, you. And traveling with the pack? Because that's as much of an opportunity to connect. to grow relationships. I stand at the start of the morning, something happen.

Another thing, I think I'm starting to hook onto. It's the concept that... When you spend your entire life in isolation, the stinky. It becomes... a skill in and of itself... It's... Just... You said the most meaningful part of coming here. And... Going to, uh, like a jazz gym or charity thing, is to learn how to conform. And not just how to do it, how to engage and disengage. In a healthy way. As I think about Starbucks, too, it's like... I think I had gone used to being engaged with the group there. Because all of them inspired me in some way. But now it's at a point where a lot of them make me feel negative. Okay. So learning how to detach from that... It is a, uh, incredibly valuable skill to have. But at the same time, running have you attached to... to the... Blake, jazz groups, and the running groups here, you know, how to just kind of fall in line with something. It's just as important as learning how to detach from. Something like Starbucks.

Also, one of the point I wanted to make is with the masturbation stuff. Good morning. Morning. When you start to remove the reward for the stimulus, I think that's what happens. where the flat barn comes from. Because I've noticed it today, but there's a lot of people. Especially runners, but... I'll be attracted too. But now, the reward for seeing more of them. Following them around has declined. I found myself more willing to let go. and see other opportunities. More plausible ones.

This week was one of increased awareness. I feel I've learned more about community, connection, and rest in this week than I have in the past couple years. It started out as a difficult week, still having not finished my quarterly and monthly planning, and having a hard time getting to it. Among with withdrawal symptoms I was experiencing subtle heart palpitations and much insomnia, causing me to overeat often and neglect deadlines. In going through this, I learned these to be burn out symptoms taxing the nervous system. I simultaneously began feeling a greater pull towards connection and community, and how id distanced myself from these in the past. In the wake of quitting my addictions, i began seeing the crutch they'd represented up until now. Each had severed me from those around me, and investing heavily in them since middle school engendered a fear of people. Ending this week watching cats at my grandmas, feeling like a proper adult for cooking for myself, maintaining cleanliness of the house, and getting urges to invite others over. I've learned much about getting in groove (or moreso how much I live outside of it) and how if I want to improve more/faster, I need to risk getting in with the crowd of people who are much farther along the path I'm traveling. I've begun realizing confidence is a symptom of repeated social interaction with strangers.

Achievements
1. In spite of resistances, talked to 3 people at ARC AND went up afterwards to a group of runners and hung out with them
2. Full rest day on Saturday and burn out day on Tuesday, recovered from both and feel much more capable afterwards
3. Finished reviews

Issues
1. Didn't put a poster up. Likely from ambiguity of where to put it up
2. Sickness at end of week 
3. Running backs pains, need new shoes
4. Car tire is still fucked
5. Too much time with ChatGPT. Using it like I used to use social media to get answers that are already out there
6. Still lacking deeper understanding of Bembe
7. Clutter at home. Get to avoid it for now but need to deal with it soon
8. Rest right now is getting more programmed, but need to continue emphasizing the awareness of when I need it AND fully leaning into it
9. Need more exposure to social situations, more challenges here. Essentially a daily practice of networking/making friends, allow deep ones to emerge naturally
10. Need to pic a gig and volunteer event
11. Money to afford all of this
12. Stalking people, weird new awareness has grown around this. Seems to be curtailing itself but need to keep an eye on this

Who's it for? 
- Curious drummers looking to explore new genres 

What's it for?
- Pathway of what to expect moving through a new genre 
- Inspired drummers (musicians) to explore curiosity

Is it better to take all ive written and write from scratch? Or categorize and cut down?

I wanted to write a final bit for the article. I'm writing today and that is that I've come to this realization that one of the most important parts of Bamba or any kind of folklore genre comes from the fact that there was no metronomes at a time, there was no way of understanding the difference between like hard set time and like relative time and so the way people kept time was really relative to each other there was also no concept of you know apply to a met like there's your time relativity was based on fitting in a in a group so when other people were playing, it was about having enough space to have this many notes in between it was about making room that way and I think coming from a period where we've had Mets for so long it puts us kind of at a disadvantage for learning this genre of music because or at least it puts me at a disadvantage for learning the music because I'm so used to playing precisely with a metronome that leaning into the way that they relax time is is completely different getting to the groove is not necessarily about playing precisely with a metronome so much as it is understanding like tendencies to move and we've and really just focusing on other things and I kind of got a glimpse of this when I was learning jazz. The idea that you shouldn't listen to yourself as much as you should get to a point where you don't have to listen to yourself at all I think taking a step back and only playing one drum part which is the Bamba Bell rhythm forces me to let go of my part. It makes it much easier to focus on what other people are doing because I'm not having to focus on my entire body. I'm just having to focus on getting the groove right on this one part and when I play along to other kind of Bemba adjacent material, I can zone in on the Shaker rhythm or the con rhythms the Kinto rhythms, Trey, scope, rhythms and stuff like that and I think by doing that it's giving me a better sense of time

I think there's an important level trying to navigate how to use something like ChatGPT effectively here and as much as I don't really appreciate its use case in my creative scenarios. I think there is a way to use it to better ourselves as musicians and so the part I've been trying to ponder without relying exclusively on ChatGPT is, what does it mean to get into groove? What are the kind of practices I need to get better at Bamba and any Afro Cuban, John rum and I do feel like there are insights from ChatGPT that aren't necessarily like from a place of understanding but they're also they're from a place of giving you information that you may not have known and one of the main things that it is brought to my attention is the idea of respect in playing this genre you know back then there was a Drum hierarchy in that you started off as the Bamba Bell until you could understand the nuances of it and then you moved up To some other pattern and then he moved up to Congo's and eventually made your way up to Kinto and the biggest part I'm taking away from this is that I don't understand why and so one of my big practices has been going back and exclusively playing the Bombay bell pattern for 30 minutes straight to kind of give myself the feeling of being in one of these ensembles or something and I feel like even and just doing that a little bit, I've I've earned a deeper respect for the groove and not losing the groove because a lot of times in these rhythms they're not changing the entire time throughout the whole ceremony especially the bell pattern. It says consistent and it's everything else that's changing around it and I think learning to adhere to that and stick completely to it and hear the way that space is played between each note changes a lot of perspective on time and group play and teamwork. And to add to all like the Metronic stuff, you know there was no metronome, and so the only way to play in time was to synchronize yourself with other people and I think it comes from a time. Period. Where people were already in sync within a tribe they were communicating with each other in this way, and I think somewhere along the way we… I lost that and in an effort to get better at it, I've been joining a run club and jazz jam group to try and force myself to connect better with other people or at least get better at learning how to be a part of some kind of inner play.

Structure:

Intro
Big theme (No metronome)
Big theme (Group interplay / respect)
Big theme (Roots)
Outro
Give each ~200 words

I have to CHOOSE to believe, whole heartedly, that music is the most important thing I could ever study. That is what it takes.
