Community drum circles
- Double up parts
- BYOD, a couple provided
- Really easy way to generate community once a week, make it free? At least at first

Writing takes on a whole new meaning rn, I feel like I can genuinely feel the emotion. I think what's stopped me for so long is the mechanical mindset of having been a programmer. Detailing every little action out is complicated, but writing to visualize and feel changes a lot. Almost like what's birthed from the outlet of dopamine addiction is an ability to enjoy emotiom

Pursue it because you love it. Because you can't breathe without it. 

I think I struggle, in open loops, with distinguishing between debt loops and yield loops. Like everything cluttering the basement is taxing my mind, same with my car problems, same with my bed, and same with appointments. But what of these are genuine priorities versus upgrades?

How do they describe someone they admire?

What I'm getting towards now is participation in mindful entertainment. Movies and books. Listening to music for hours at a time and doing nothing else. A desire to participate in Music in a way that I get lost in it

Would be really cool to get a Bembe set up where right foot was hooked up to clave, freeing hands for the conga lines

How do we imitate the Shekere rhythm on drums? That's a big challenge, because it's not exactly 16th notes

Things bogging my mind:
- Anxiety around teaching Jalen
- Mom commenting on dishes in the sink before I'm done eating
	- At a deeper level, pattern of her interrupting my calm with her anxiety and feeling obligated to do what she asks
- Tire issue
- doctors dentist eye and vet appointments, associated costs
	- Is there any for eye? Or even for Doctor? Dentist probably
- Finishing out planning
- Anxiety around dilligence towards scheduling breaks
- Poor sleeping recently
	- Bed issues, not relaxing in time
- Impending time sinks (lessons)
- impending insurance payment
- Setting forth a lot of goals I actually have to live up to which are taking me outside my comfort zone
- Meeting deadlines
- Finding time for everything
- needing rest
- Wanting to plan a me trip but not being able to afford it
- Not believing in the short term (3 months and less) future I've set out for myself.
- Declittering spaces and tasks

I think it boils down to
- Expected costs putting pressure on my lifestyle without even having started to grow it, fogging my peace of mind
- Poor diligence towards rest routine, both at night and in scheduling. Planning before bed exacerbates this
- short term task overload, not trusting structure. Also feels like too many days dedicated to planning? 
	- No simple way of viewing week overview 

I think it's all indecision in one way or another.

Am I napping because I need a nap or because I'm procrastinating?

I am resting until 2:30 OR heart returns to normal

Horniness feels present but muted right now. I think it's the burnout combined with withdrawals.

It feels like the absence of social media and video games shines this major light on my ability to relax and find comfort in calm. Because I don't feel boredom right now. I feel empty and exhausted. My heart is returning to normal and I'm breathing well again, but the thought of returning to reality feels daunting and impossible.

One of the largest things I've noticed in the combination of all of this is an over-reliance on social media / porn, and focus on those places, for access to attractive women. Having their photos readily available at the touch of a button makes it so easy to be "self-reliant" because you never have to be with anyone to have this constant source of "affection" and beauty around. Especially with an imaginative brain, I didn't need anyone. The positivity in my imagination was so much stronger enough that relationships felt lackluster, disappointing, and often times completely negative in comparison. But when you don't have those immediate responses to lean on, you actually have to go outside your house to find it. It's something that keeps coming back to mind today: when I was at the run club, every woman I saw on the beltline was my type. Every guy I talked to is someone I felt inspired by. Social media and masturbation made these things feel impossible before hand because there was an easier way: sitting and watching someone else do it. Going to her profile and looking at the same photos I'd seen a million times, imagining the life we could live if we fell in love in person. I could deal with loneliness by seeing her picture and deluding myself into thinking I was accomplishing things by watching him do it. Without those, I find myself leaving the house more. Walking stores or going places, and actually attempting to be around people I want to be like. When I'm not constantly afraid of seeing it on social media, I feel more courageous

How do we approach rest with discipline and mindfulness? Without forcing it? Physiological symptoms? Main problem is I don't at all believe in it. I understand it logically but there's so much pain and trauma around rest, especially never having intentionally experienced it that the idea makes me more uncomfortable than burnout
- One way is just to become more aware of symptoms and signs of burnout/fatigue

Las night was a really fucking hard one. Spent probably two hours fighting off urges and it fucking sucks because I'm trying to rest from this burnout and get more sleep so I went to bed early enough but I just ended up tossing, turning, and trying not to succumb. I made it! But now I'm exhausted, irritated, and stressed tf out because it's a week into the new year and instead of fighting towards my goals I'm fighting burnout and fighting the urge to masturbate. I know I need to think of this as still fighting towards my goals but sometimes it's hard to see the relevance

Burnout is not as bad anymore, def still feel it in my back but breathing is better. Noticeable physical exhaustion? Like I'm getting sick. Minor headache.

Imagining, staring at, or really indulging women's feet/shoes in any fashion has become an emotional detriment at this point. It makes me feel like a creep and it worsens the urge to masturbate. Especially if the idea is to quit altogether, the obsession has no place in my new life

Still focus on recovery today. Can meditate on Jalen's thing throughout the day just to get it over with. Light exercise at best.

Where do I want to take Jalen from here? Continue emphasizing the daily practice. Combining stickings. Make sure and ask how difficult it is. Also when making these vids, do low fidelity rn. Invest in quality later, better to just get them out and test them right now

Getting fancy with videos right now is a moot point because I have no idea what works and wha don't. Need to just make it quick and adjust. Use them as experiments, but make them deeply personal. That's how to make it work

Living without the distractions, without the numbing, is really fucking hard right now. I feel so anxious and so

Experiencing another flatline today. I think when I'm not burnt out, withdrawals are easier to manage. One takeaway I got from yesterday is that it doesn't take that long to rest. Or at least, I underestimate how even a little rest can help. Even with just Tuesday off, I was back to pushing myself yesterday. Learning to trust is part of the process, and I want to begging ot understand how long rest is needed to recover. Really just want to rid myself of the illusion that momentum means solely pushing.

Best way to do drum blog is either write observations frequently or SOC for 1000 (estimate number) words a day and edit together something cohesive on mondays? Or talk it out too

A lot of creation is SOC, trust, and learning how to work with those. Too many people try to make
It a conscious process, but it's meant to be done unconsciously and using conscious energy as an adaptive tool. Like you have to let go of trying to control it, create constantly, allow it to flow, and observe it. Let the feedback guide you in the future. That's how you grow and create more constantly. I think this is what people mean by getting in the groove and listening. I realized this the past couple days when playing guitar. I knew how to shred or play licks, but once I just hit a random note I had little idea of where to go, how to not lose the groove with it. Same with drums, it seems I don't listen enough to my own playing because it devolves into noodling, but I'm starting to learn that it's possible to feel it as much when you play it as when listening to others, and true growth happens from that place. From getting into a groove and not losing it. Letting the fingers move where they want to go and adapting from there. This can be done within a structure. 

What are the tools that make this possible?

Need to get LEAN. Cutting out all the food and items in my life that don't matter or don't contribute to the greater path.

Just don't engage with her. Create the boundary and adhere to it. She's just a thorn trying to create controversy. The obsessive part comes from giving too much attention to it, feeding it with your attention. The sooner you let go, the better you'll feel. Come back to center :D

"Now," he continued, "this is real serious stuff. You can treat it like a game when you are just beginning, but even then, your intent must be pure. Once you are confident with your abilities, the power increases. At that time, how you use it has a tremendous effect on all Life everywhere. Right now, you can treat it like a game, but know it is not one." 
- _The Music Lesson_ on Meditation

It's interesting in the ways I've noticed this.

Insights on the way (name of blog)

I shoulda stopped by and hung out with those people in the run club post run. Feel guilty. Lesson for next time 

What do you want me to do right now?

Options are either go home or go up and hang with ARC, but if I'm totally honest my main motivator here is just to watch women on the belt line. I feel like I'm being more social, the best thing is to do the opposite of what I'd normally do (go home). My resistance is I'm totally drained mentally and socially. I feel like I made a lot of mistakes today that I'm willing to learn from.

In total honesty, I feel embarrassed and exposed. And the main question is, is this enough for today or should I try for more?

I also kinda feel rejected by two people I didn't even talk to. Both could be Her (at least physically) and I feel like I've failed trying to communicate with them. 

I DID IT! It was uneventful and I talked to the wrong people and fumbled throughout, BUT I DID IT!

The most energizing part of runners is the people. They're all so generous, so rewarding. There's this common understanding that we are choosing suffering in a way that will bring us joy. Doing it together makes it easier. Like when I went up, it turns out there was a different run club set up and they were just as eager to share as if I was in their club. They greeted me with enthusiasm and congratulated me on finishing. 

I met and talked to more persistent members this week. Was still socially out of it, but had good conversations with Spencer (Teaches adults with disabilities) and Danny (potential trail runner). The practice I've been getting into has mainly been about initiating conversations with strangers. It's daunting and uncomfortable right now, but I'm really proud of you for doing it. It feels like it's getting easier. I need to do more social things that get me out of this comfort zone, where I have to talk to and meet new people. Mastering the practice of making new friends and networking, it's something that I feel is such a logical extension from the work last year. Doing so today feels like, even with just 3 people, a stretch. But I feel like that's part of what it takes to walk into any room and feel like yourself. Two things i also noticed today:
- I talked with and surrounded myself with people who look like me. I think that's a matter of comfort, especially in growing more social, but I think moving forward I need to make an effort to talk to the people who are living in the shape I want to live in. They carry a completely different energy, and I feel like I have a lot more to learn from them than I do people who look/act like me. Even when I feel out of place amongst them, it's the challenge I need.
- That naturally extends to talking with women. I feel like the same resistance that presented itself when thinking about talking with the adept runners came up when thinking about talking to the women I was attracted to there. Yet, as I opened up with more people, it felt easier and easier to imagine a future where I could communicate with them easily. 
In all cases right now, socializing feels tantamount to jumping in a cold shower. There's much resistance to the start and when I get in I'm trying to get out. The more distant they are from how I look (whether that be because they're a woman or incredibly fit) the colder the water feels. My goal isn't to make the water warm, but to find more ways to enjoy it.

In other words, the goal is to create a sense of belonging no matter where I go and who I talk to. I naturally feel more confident around my herd

Something I thought a lot about on my ride home: I think I need to start doing a weekly overview. In creating better structure, I'm starting to get comfortable with the stability, and I think the way to level that up is to, during each review, get an overview of the week where I can start seeing at a glance what the week is to look like. Laid out:
- Look at the week. Understand things like when work is, social experiences, etc. get a good understanding of things like obstacles and where breaks need to go
- When doing this, it would be good to approach more with intention. Plan meals, purchases even, make it a point to try and also understand where tasks can be order on. Makes it so energy is spent on abstaining on the bad rather than deciding on ambiguity.
- Make a point to develop understanding and intentions during this time so that throughout the week, energy is taken away from decision making and put completely into fulfillment
I already find myself happier this way. It makes me more resilient to obstacles. In the long term, with things like budgeting, it'll also make it easier to stick to a plan.

Also, the more practice I can get socializing with strangers, the more open I can be day to day. Could see myself being someone who sits down at a coffee shop and immediately has a conversation with whoever is next to him. Creates so many more opportunities tha way, not to mention meaningful connections

The more I get away from the internet, the more I see how harmful it can be. We need to have unanswerable questions because we need to have a system for finding answers. We have to develop the tool of exploring curiosity. I notice this with Bembe, where every time i have a question, i try to go to chatgpt. But more pften now i realize i need to be trying to find these answers on my own, because tha doesn't teach understanding. It makes you have to do more research, but it also teaches you to trust your ow decision making and resilience to consequential decisions.
