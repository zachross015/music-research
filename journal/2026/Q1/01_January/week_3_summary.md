# Week 3

---

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the week in 1000 characters or less. -->

The crux of this week was about effective planning and socialization. I started the week at work struggling with the aggressive negativity in Zoe. I started questioning why, when most of the people around me supported me wholely, I continued focusing on people like her who were aggressively negative. This question carried on further in the week as I went on a camping expedition with Kevin and Amanda. The trip was one of the most wonderful trips I've been on, with most of our time spent either driving or exploring beautiful locations. In reading *music* by Ted Gioia, my eyes had opened to the music the covers every moment and place in the world. I spent most my time in the swamps and forests we'd travelled looking for the music of the wilderness, hearing all I could. In contrast, I fought mental battles on connection. Through the trip, I'd realized I've coveted attraction by being an attractive person at a surface level while keeping people at a distance. I'd realized the people I'd grown close with came from habitually bringing them down to the level of shame in order to bond with their demons. In leaving and starting again, I feel I have a new direction of wanting depth through joy and happiness.

### Friction

<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->
- Didn't post the flyer. Easiest explanation is I'd overbooked for the week without intentionally assigning a day or time it needed to be done by, but also had a better idea for a color scheme. Really an excuse, need to just decide on a new color scheme and move forward
- The attraction issue. This may just be residual from addiction and clear up on its own, but theres now an awareness of how I've only gathered depth through negativity or shitting on others. Even deep conversations in the past have all been due to an over-emphasis on listening and curiosity related to people's demons.
- "Holier than thou" symptom. Not sure if its still a thing, but should keep an eye on it
- Attachment to beauty and layering expectations in while staring at them
- Overspending
- Overeating
- Not enough water
- Neck/Shoulder pains
- Tire
- Cluttered space
