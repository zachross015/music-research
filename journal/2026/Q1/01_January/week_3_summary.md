# Week 4

---

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the week in 1000 characters or less. -->
Started this week thinking camping was a sufficient recovery item, and being hit with the realization it wasn't. Still watching the cats at Nana's and Grandpa's. Spent the week struggling to relax, whether form poor diet or poor relaxation. In spite of this, I made ample progress throughout the week on business and practice. Most of what I'd come to ingrain was the weight of groove, and the ways it's been missing in my life. Things like systematic scheduling, systematic diet, and systematic rest have all been missing and knowing this now has opened awareness to the cognitive load of their unreliability. Improvements are happening in these areas now, but their lacking has left me burnt out throughout the week. The final days were wrapped in an Ice Storm, keeping me pent up with Joey & Co, wherein I finally allowed myself to crash from the sickness I'd been dredged with in my lack of relaxing.

### Achievements

<!-- Write out what accomplishments you made over the week. -->
1. Finished brand color scheme
2. Ran another 10 mile
3. Defined the different job roles in the company
4. 3 hour long meditations
5. Went to a jazz jam

### Friction

<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->
- It doesnt feel like the burnout has one definable source. More rest is needed in general, but it also seems like caffeine plays a part (I'm saying right now as I feel the anxiety of caffeine crash), diet, and lack of preparation/rest after workouts. Recovery from them seems to be impacting me more than I would think, and it all gets exacerbated by sweets
- Horny as fuck all week, much more than I thought I'd be. Fighting urges can also explain everything
- Didn't put up the posters. Design looked like piss in print, but also used distance as an excuse. May have resolved this by just finishing up the color scheme.
- Still can't afford all the help I need
- Resistance to work came in part from no clear boundaries between when I work and when I don't (not allocating time off from the beginning, or envisioning myself having to work constantly
- Planning at a week level makes daily intentions not happen

## Review

### What stopped you from achieving last week's goals?

Goals lacked enough intention and clarity to make them executable even in the state I was in, combined with overhead of withdrawl symtpoms and exhaustion.

### What does life look like at the end of the week?
