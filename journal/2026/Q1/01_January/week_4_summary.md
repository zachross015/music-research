# Week 5

---

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the week in 1000 characters or less. -->
This week was one of rest and courage. Fire and ice. Started of the week being stormed out and stuck at Nana's house. In trying to relax, alot of old temptations built up. I couldn't sleep at night because I was so desparate to masturbate. Upon looking at the emotions underlying the urges, I was able to glimpse at something more fruitful. I had since my first days masturbating used it as a tool for escape. That, video games, and social media were all numbing procedures which survived me through times where I never learned how to defend myself, or even be with myself. They gave me fantasy connections when I didn't believe I could survive real ones. The most recent evolution highlighted the pleasure I found in being miserable, contented to self-erasure so long as it brought them joy. In seeing this, I began working towards changing it. I finally performed in my first jazz jam, opened up more about my drumming career, and attended a game night with Russ. Doing these helped me realize that I'd glorified isolation in suffering, which inhibited my progress. From this, I've decided to alter this year's trajectory with what I've learned in connection.

### Achievements

<!-- Write out what accomplishments you made over the week. -->
1. PLAYED MY FIRST JAZZ JAM
2. Made it through the week without masturbating
3. Spent enough time with rest/relaxation to understand and be with it better
4. The concept of groove and active listening is becoming much stronger in my head, and time is stabilizing more.

### Friction

<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->
1. Didn't finish Project Zephyr, mainly because I've decided it's not the best route for now. It would be way too much change in a way that I wouldn't get good answers. Deciding instead to move from Starbucks to a lessons company, where I'll actually make decent pay for part time work
2. There are still days where I rub my dick against the bed or look at women's shoes. Urges are declining (I say from a flatline) but when they are here they're voracious
3. Completely new direction needed from where I thought I was going. And now, I think this has repeatedly happened BECAUSE I don't have someone further on the trail telling me where to go. Now I feel like I do.
4. Soloing is apparently not great
5. Didn't practice the last 5 days. Told myself I was breaking for recalibration. I think that's true, but unsure the intensity of that statement
6. Diet. Diet. Diet. The more I improve my diet, the more I can feel days where I didn't adhere to it. It results in laziness, brain fog, full body lethargy, etc, and for the amount of things I'm tyring to improve my life in, diet has to take the forefront 
7. Structure should improve, especially around sleep. Trying to build new conditions (eg tea -> shower -> sleep) to replace earlier behaviors, but the more I can become consistent in my structure, the easier it's going to be to grow. AND the easier it's going to be to afford bigger and better opportunities. I live for a regulated cycle now and find much joy in it
