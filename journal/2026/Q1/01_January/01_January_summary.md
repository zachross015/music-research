# January

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the month in 1000 characters or less. -->

January was all about connection, relaxation, structure, and integration. I'd spent the month recovering from my addictions in masturbation, social media, and video games. The cost of having held these addictions for so long made themselves clear through the month, often resulting in sleepless nights tossing and turning as fantasies let themselves loose in my mind. The overwhelming lack of structure and inability to relax exacerbated this. Waking up from the stupor these addictions held on my allowed me to finally embrace connections with people in a way I'd never done before. It increased my confidence perhaps more than anything. A recurring thought is "I finally feel like a normal person."  The results of this and the work put in throughout the month were that I attended two run clubs and two jazz jams, making friends at both events, and I decided against starting my own business in favor of joining someone else's. Ending the month feeling great about the progress, and for one of the first times feeling just as refreshed going into the next month as I had the previous. Above all else, there's a greater relaxation into surrender, realizing the best work is done in communion.

### Achievements

<!-- Write out the major accomplishments you made over the month in an ordered list. -->
1. Played my first jazz jam
2. Made friends at the run club
3. Made it through an entire month without masturbating, video gaming, or going on social media (and feel better for it)
4. Improved sense of structure, relaxation, and groove

### Recurring Frictions

<!-- Create a unordered list of everything that was a recurring issue throughout each week. -->
- Cluttered spaces
- Overspending and eating poorly
- Still caving to horniness at times. Not explicitly masturbating, but not fighting temptations
  - Symptom of burnout instead of discipline
- Not completing all the workouts of the week
- Decline in practice time (partly from being at Nana's)-
- The way I connect with people and talk with them, especially strangers, feels loaded right now. Depth is bringing them down to my demons and surface is expecting them to find pleasure in erasing me

## Review

#### The ONE Thing

<!-- Write out a diagnosis of the root problem that occurred between recurring frictions and -->
<!-- work to find the single, simplest action you can take (consistently) towards removing that issue. -->
Resources are scattered and there's too much baggage from the past that's making us move slower. Everything needs a spot in the structure that can be relied on.

The simplest action that aligns with all my goals is to create a stronger structure:
- Have a designated place for everything
- Sell off or throw away everything else

### Goals

<!-- List out AT MOST 3 goals for the upcoming month. -->
1. Remove all the clutter
   - Sell/Trash 1 item everyday (gradual progress)
2. Get a lessons job and leave Starbucks
    - Make a list of all the possible locations in the area (or groups of virtual/in home ones)
    - Revise resume based on website information
    - Reach out to them personally by going in and talking to them or calling over phone
      - Maybe Mimsa connect
    - Talk to Kendall, Jaida, and 1 other person (Jackson? Kevin?) about reccomendations
    - Start job March 1.
3. Improve jazz soloing
    - Weekly jam session, get feedback at each one
    - Habitualize active listening, mainly the other parts and knowing wehre you fit
    - Practice internal time-keeping
    - Practice active listening
    - Practice soloing (main thing)
    - Ie., *never leave time* mentality
