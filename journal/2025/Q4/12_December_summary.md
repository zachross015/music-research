# December

---

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the month in 1000 characters or less. -->

December was one of the first months where I embraced structure. It started off with recognizing the lack of presence in everyday life and the clutter which constantly fogged my mind. It was a residual of the lifestyle I had growing up, but I wasn't going to be victim to it any more. The month was spent creating and reinforcing disciplined structures within, and building methods which made it difficult to fail. As a result, I practiced more than ever before, I learned more, I spent more time with people, and escaped all negativity that previously drained my days. The biggest insights of the month were that you have to do it the hard way to find shortcuts, so pull up the bootstraps and get to it. I ended the month with more money than I began in spite of holiday spendings, feeling more generous for having given, and with a definite plan for the future that feels accomplishable. I also quit masturbation, social media, and video games and left the month feeling hopeful and full of time (timeful).

### Achievements

<!-- Write out the major accomplishments you made over the month in an ordered list. -->

Possibly the greatest change of all is the idea that if you believe it to be true and do it for others, it will happen. Every achievement I had this month contributes to this new mindset.

- Quit dopamine addictions, which I'd for the longest time excused as being necessary for my growth when in fact removing them grew me faster than ever before.
- Identified an ankle injury and created rest to recover from it
- Implemented a daily system which is dilligent enough to push me but flexible enough to prevent burnout
- Structured the next year in a way that feels achievable
- Learned all of Reflections and Monk's Dream in little time, got to a level of jazz proficiency where I can play by ear instead of having to transcribe everything.

### Recurring Frictions

<!-- Create a unordered list of everything that was a recurring issue throughout each week. -->
- A lot of open loops on my radar. Everytime I close these loops, life gets better (even at a financial detriment). But I'm not in the habit yet of finishing what I've started or completing what I've set out to do. 
  - Bed is in terrible shape, causing many neck pains
  - Disorganized spaces
  - Car troubles
- A new light has been shed on how disorganized my spaces are. I think once again I've fallen into the trap into waiting until the next step to take care of where I'm at, but I look aroundt he rooms that I occupy and see loads of crap sprawled everywhere
   - Likely a reflection of tolerance for mental clutter
- Sense of groove is terrible, constantly leaving it
