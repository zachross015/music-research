# Week 1

---

## Summary

It has been an excellent week of progress. At the beginning of the previous week, I'd quit masturbating, playing video games, and going on social media. This week was a deeper commitment to these values and I feel heavily rewarded for doing so. It was the first week I actually felt the progress. Deepening connections with everyone, more time to get everything I wanted to done, and more wholesome feelings of attractions. It's allowed me to relax into the structures I've been creating for myself instead of constantly falling back into numbing procedures, and I feel grateful to God for showing me this way. It seems like fantasies are becoming more realistic as well. Aside from this, I spent the entirety of the week both planning out and, with intention, deeply visualizing the path forward. I went to a Run Club, I cleaned up my automatic structures with recurring checklists that I now feel confident I will be able to accomplish, and I revamped my drum room once again for automated recording. The future finally feels plausible.

### Achievements

- Went to a run club and as a result made new friends and hit 5 PB
- Didn't masturbate for 7 days.
- Finished planning out a generous year with tiny consistent tasks.
- Finished website gen 1
- Started everyday with intention and with the exception of 1 or 2 tasks, completed all I set out to do

### Friction

<!-- Create an unordered list of everything that you notice caused friction throughout the week. -->

I didn't face too much friction this week. It was relatively smooth sailing tbh

- Brandi nagging about not getting her a christmas gift (tbf I did say I would) is annoying the fuck out of me
- Structure is very rigid and doesn't leave alot of room for spontaneity. Haven't seen it be too big of an issue, but it might distance me from some people. 
- Growing awareness of how cluttered my spaces are
  - Need to sell off most of my stuff. Would be good for paying off debt but also for moving towards my vision 
  - Can we bring someone in to sell all this stuff if we organize it? Would be willing to pay someone to do most the work
- Sense of groove is terrible, constantly leaving it
- Still indulging fantasies for what feels like way too long. Instead of touching myself to masturbate I'm just rubbing it on the bed
- Bed is in terrible shape, causing many neck pains
- Mediations have taken a back seat. So has diet. Both are impacting running.
