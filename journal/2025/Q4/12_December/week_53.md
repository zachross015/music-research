The urges seem to exacerbate in public. At work rn and I feel this like persistent anxiety. I don't think it's as much I need to masturbate as it is the feeling even if I wanted to, I couldn't get away to do it. Feels like a hostage situation in that regards

But it also is occurring to me that maybe my issue is I'm surrounding myself with unfulfilled people 

Jazz exercise/meditation: Play autopilot and completely focus on individual parts (eg one time through just on piano, sax, bass, etc)

Definitely starting to flatline. The usual stuff wasn't really doing anything last night, and "what's the point" rang in my head. On the other side, I feel a lot less guilty now than before. More curious, creative, open minded. In a way I'm much more prone to connection. Talking to people is a bit easier, especially kids.

There's also a habitual pattern of confusing the things I want to do with how I feel in the moment, which is part of why it's so hard to engage in new things. Especially when I don't always feel great. Lack of discipline where the only solution is to do it anyways

There's a much stronger pull towards more real stimuli. Like being around certain people, seeing photos of that woman from mad men or even just Hoka shoes, it all turns me on. Not in a guilty way either. But the difficult part is pretty much anything makes me leak now

A woman just walked into the coffee shop I'm sitting in, and it's the first time I've noticed a full difference. I feel attracted to her with my entire body. It's not a fear, but a full body pull to talk to her, be intimate with her. Like it's not the fantasy dragging me to her. It's just her. It's so fucking refreshing. And it's like for the first time, o don't have to try to have a boner. I just have one. It makes me feel like before, all the times I was expecting one and didn't get one wasn't because I was misaligned, but instead because I should've had one and didn't from numbing or overuse. I don't feel scared of it, only charged by it. Like I could do anything with it. And it's real, not imaginary

Just now realizing I've been isolating. It's weird when I look at it, it's not intentional. It's a matter of priority I think. But making New Years plans is confusing because it's like I either stay up and hang out with people or wake up early and hike with people. It's like...idk. I want to do the second. Or like, I want to be around the type of people who do the second. But all the people I know are doing the first. It feels weird I'm doing the former. Like it's this weird paradox I guess? I don't really care about New Years all that much. For everyone around me it just seems like another reason to drink. And I wish it wasn't that. I wish the people around me wanted to wake up early and go hike instead, that I wasn't surrounded by the parties. It makes me feel crazy. And so I'm sitting in this space where I've been going against the edge for like weeks now, basically isolating because no one around me has even remotely close of a schedule. And I'm having to decide between what I want (hike) and what will socialize me (staying up). I think that's the nerve I hit a couple of weeks ago when sitting with my family. And all the connection stuff. It's not necessarily that I don't connect, it's that I live in a world that's isolating me.

Part of the isolation has been embarrassment. Anxiety around my life path. And honestly, it feels like I'm doing a lot to shape the world, not a lot to raise self esteem. Unless what I'm doing is raising self esteem? But also why should I care what they think? 

It's kinda like, if I don't have to talk about it, then I don't have to worry. If there's no one there to make fun of me, then I'm safe. And I realize I've moved somewhat far from the path I was wanting to lead, the person I was becoming before. I don't know if things were better, but there was a time I was more willing to take social risks. More willing to say "I'm a musician." Today, it feels hard to say that. And I haven't reaffirmed that in myself. So it feels like I'm trying to create a lot of circumstances to recover, or protect myself, from that.

It makes me think that routine is great, but getting out of routine is painful.

I feel harsh cynical and insecure

How do you decide the difference between avoiding conflict and choosing not to participate in drama? Brandi is coming at me talking about how I hang out with everyone except her. There's truth to this, I don't like being around her. 

I think I'm caught at a stand off where I can't tell what the version I want to be should do. There's the confrontational approach where I talk to her directly. Then there's the idea that maybe it's someone I just need to cut out

Definitely feeling a flatline now. There's certain things I grasp onto, but for the most part I feel indifferent. There's a much deeper attraction in person, and also a detraction from certain people.

I AM an authority in music. It's time for me to decide that I make music my friends enjoy. 

I'm at this critical point where getting better at music and life is no longer about practicing in isolation so much as it is bringing what I've learned to places where I can use these things as tools for connection. And I begin to realize the distance between what I have and what I want is summed by the way I feel around my friends. I want to be around beautiful people who find the joy in anything.

Simultaneously, I've begun realizing that I can't change the world, but the energy I carry changes everyone around me. My mental health practices have begun to extend beyond myself and into the people around me, and the more I commit to being the truest and best version of myself, the more joy I and the people around me experience. I become an authority by committing to my values and allowing others to participate in the joy I experience because of it. 

Everything I do tha betters my life sets an example for everyone else. When I meditate and talk about it, people around me meditate. When I adventure, they adventure. When I plan and prepare, so do they. When I run, so do they. When I love Music with all that I can, they do too. When I quit social media, so will they. When I quit gaming so will they. When I make more of an effort to be apart of their world, so will they. Everything starts with me. 

When I believe that I'm already the best version of myself and remembering how I got there, then they will too. You can't teach, all you can do is show. They will learn when they see your results. You can't change them, but you can create an impact so dense that they fall in.

Visualize what it feels like to be around them.

I think the energy drain really is an illusion of Resistance. It's 11:29. I woke up at 5:15, ran, and meditated, and I feel great. Joyful and at peace. Even more accomplished for having done those things.

Gotten to a point in bebop where it's gonna be much more beneficial if I just play along to tunes, zone out from the drummer, and follow the leader. Starting to notice today how the energy and feel changes better playing alongside it than playing note for note

Actually, noticing this more outside of Bebop too. Was jamming to Undertale stuff to compare against earlier this year, and the most distinctive things i noticed was that now I have a much stronger attention to holding the groove steady. There isn't as much filling around as there is just trying to groove with the song and fit my part, which is a huge advancement. Doing so has made me realize though how little I actually know about fill work. Like most my fills are pretty half ass and barely have any set up. Also a lack of syncopation in important parts. But the fills are an important part. I'm beginning to see how it could be possible to FEEL like how Snarky Puppy must feel all the time by just playing the right parts and listening intently. Definitely need to groove better and listen better

Show up consistently. To the jam, to the club, etc. let the relationships flourish naturally. Be comfortable with beginnings. Gradual growth.

Realize that friendships aren't forced. They're a consequence of repeated exposure. Go there, be yourself, and attract naturally. 

You weren't friends with everyone at Starbucks on the first day. Same with PMA. And drumline. It's too much pressure to expect us to show up and automatically be the most gregarious person there. That comes with time.

It almost seems like there's a correlation between gaining weight and the more self-erasing fantasies. Like, knowing that I use weight as a way to be more invisible, I gain weight whenever the fantasies are more about being objectified

There's a new ideal of wishing I had ear training. Wishing I could hear the chord progressions and knowing them immediately, then being able to play on any instrument (really piano or guitar) then plopping down on that instrument and play it. It's not the highest priority, especially with all the changes I've been making. But eventually it will be one

Holding eye contact longer now

Attraction to footwear declined today. It's there but not charging.

My spaces are all littered with unnecessary garbage that needs to be cleaned out. Bedroom and basement included.

Watching old drum videos, it's obvious I used to play drums and not Music. So much overplaying, so little to grab onto. Even my most recent practices, there's a growing awareness of when I lose the groove, and how often fills leave the groove behind
