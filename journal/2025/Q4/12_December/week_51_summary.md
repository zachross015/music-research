# Week 51

It has been an incredibly productive week. There was still alot of teetering on whether or not to finish the business structure, but many times this week I laced up the bootstraps and did the atual work. In doing so, I was given the insight of hard work and perserverance, and the lack of it I'd had leading up until now. I think I had confused self-care so frequently with giving up--burn out with resistance--that I'd let myself down constantly. But in the past week, what I'd learned was that (1) shortcuts only become obvious after doing the tedious parts and (2) by completing all I set out to do, and making sure I push through until the end, I get so much more satisfaction out of my tasks. The final thing I've learned from this is that in order to do this most effectively, I have to be prepared with tasks ahead of time and remove all sense of direction and ambiguity before setting forth.

Ended this weekend with some laziness, but for the first time being able to properly identify it. Moving forward, I've deleted all my social media, video games, etc. I've grown reliant on things like Youtube, Instagram, etc as a crutch for artificial growth when real growth is going to come from experiences.

## Achievements

1. Deleted all of social media
2. Identified an ankle injury and, instead of proceeding with workouts, took the week for recovery. (Which fucking sucks)
3. Spent each day seeing all tasks through to completion (when completion was defined), no matter the cost

## Friction

1. A new light has been shed on how disorganized my spaces are. I think once again I've fallen into the trap into waiting until the next step to take care of where I'm at, but I look aroundt he rooms that I occupy and see loads of crap sprawled everywhere
   1. Likely a reflection of tolerance for mental clutter
2. The recording setup in the drum room is way to annoying, occupies too much space, is flimsy, and doesnt accomplish many of the goals it is now there for (observing practice)
3. Inability to properly identify and re-create drum tones
4. No backlog of music to be working on 
5. Indecision on musical direction for the time being
   1. Is it better to continue with jazz soloing and really hammer it in OR branch out into a new style? Jazz, while I'm not an expert, is getting much more comfortable and am at risk of diminishing returns for the time being
6. After all my deliberation, I still have no idea what the structure I want for my business to be. All I know now is that it needs to start as just me while providing enough distance to work on gigs and session work
7. "Finding the right people" is not being done in any regards. There is no practice or routine set in place where I'd even come across new people
   1. Distance from the social events where I'd find anyone
8. The idea that I need people to be impressed with me is making it hard to enter situations where I'm a noob
   1. Ie lacking humility
9. Overeating, Pinterest as Porn, video game addiction, and many other dopamine outlets are disconnecting me from people 

## The ONE Thing

Honestly, it's not one thing. I think it's a matter of clutter (both mentally and physically), task overload, and prep work. I think now that I've become more dillignet and disciplined alot of this will be resolved much sooner. But I think I need the following:
- Make sure that there's plenty to do in the prep work column. Not in the sense of things have to be done, but in the sense of having a pool to take from. Eg
  - For running, make sure theres plenty of snacks and hydration stocked. Make sure running clothes and exercise outfits are easily accesible
  - Make sure things like laundry are taken care of 
  - Have a pool of songs I want to transcribe/learn
  - Set aside time on Sundays to look for social events, or in general anything to replace addictions (especially porn)
  - Always have a pool of business tasks that can be knocked out, make them unambiguous and simple
- Gradually remove clutter from all the spaces 
  - Reduce clutter by moving things vertically or shrinking

## Goals

1. Write out everything I want to accomplish next year
   1. Eg $100000, what it means to learn Afro Cuban (and full immersion)
2. Work backwards and create plan
3. Remove basement clutter

## Notes

For Afro-Cuban, Samba Savannah might be a good opportunity. Even just talking to the owner about resources
