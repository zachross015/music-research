# Week 50

This week was almost pure progress. Everything about structure has begun inhabiting my mind and routines. So much so that I've begun recognizing how critical having a consistent structure and the discipline to maintain it is to my progress. 

The most important thing I've learned over the past week is that the idea that I don't have energy to complete things--whether it be finishing a workout, practicing for however long, coming home from work to continue personal work, etc--has instead been a lack of discipline. Enacting discipline throughout the day by completing all I intend to do has resulted in being much happier, feeling less stressed out at the end of the day, developing a larger sense of self-trust, and ending the day with zero guilt on how the day was spent. It's also helped immensly in moving me towards my goals. Learning to trust myself in this way helps me believe fully that setting out to accomplish goals (even financial goals) will become achievable as I set my mind to them.

Ended the week spending time with grandpa Dave and the rest of my family. Was a great time that I cherished.

## Achievements

1. 10+ hours of practice
2. Came up with consistent, attainable routines for work
3. Got mom's christmas gifts
4. Started building business structure

## Friction

There was very little friction this week. It all ended up going pretty smoothly.

- Lots of things running through my mind from the future
- still no business structure set up
- Cards didn't get done
- A lot of open loops on my radar. Everytime I close these loops, life gets better (even at a financial detriment). But I'm not in the habit yet of finishing what I've started or completing what I've set out to do. 
- Financial situation still sucks

## The ONE Thing

Intentions, routines, and goals need to be educated on the current goals we are setting out to achieve. The christmas cards and business structure didn't get finished because they weren't given priority AND they weren't given a time.

## Goals

1. Send all 20 christmas cards (Monday).
2. Finish business structure.
3. Plan structure for next year.
