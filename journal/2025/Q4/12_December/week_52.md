I'm zach ross a first born and bred musician offshooting from my parents and grandparents. I started playing drums at the ripe age of 8, started taking lessons at 10, and haven't given up since. I had a career path set out for me as a computer scientist yet decided this was more important. In 2013, I was part of a drumline that took home the National Championships at the USBands competition. Since college, I've played in jazz, funk, jam band, rock, and pop ensembles. Music is my home. my meditation. my safe space. It has been there for me through every break up, every job rejection, every painful scenario and every one of my best days, drums were there with me. Music became my obsession over time because of the way I connected with other people through it. It was never just about the music, but about everything around it. The people, the friends I made along the way. The attention I got. The feeling of playing that first gig. That feeling of playing a gig well. My mission in life is to connect and inspire people with rhythm. From 2016-2019 I performed with the GCSU Jazz band as an auxiliary percussionist, playing alongside a number of guest artsits including Jeff Coughin. I've toured around the South East including Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. I've played sold out shows at Blue Room, Barrelhouse, and Smiths Olde Bar, and have played shows for audiences sized 2,000+.

What is the intention?

Instill confidence

Looking at other drummers' websites, its interesting seeing how people market their stuff. For instance, I've been targeting beginners, so the things I'm thinking about solving are "learn your favorite songs" "read and write music" "jam with friends" etc. But Looking at Anika Niles website, 

> She can help you progress in a variety of directions, whether it’s building a focused practice routine or working on specific styles, coordination, time & feel, odd meters, dynamics, and much more. For the lessons you will need your electronic device, a stable wifi connection and a practice pad or drum kit. 

The things that appeal to more advanced drummers (styles, coordination, etc) would not at all apply to a beginner or a parent of a beginner. It's worth noting that that would be a completely different offer. Appealing to drummers of all levels would actually be bad for marketing right now

Maybe it's just an incubator. That's what I keep coming back to. It's a space that helps musicians cultivate their own personal brand. It doesn't market for them, but instead develops the tools that help musicians market themselves?
Like the idea is:
- central space that has all the tools to teach lessons
- Rent out a room for lessons period, part of the payment goes towards the studio (automatic and online)
	- Have musicians sign up?
- Musicians can pay for credits that teach them marketing and sales skills and leadership skills
- Expect the artists to find their own students

Not masturbating is changing the landscape of my horniness. Like...increasing it. Sometimes to incredibly high levels. I saw this woman in the lobby of Starbucks, nothing special about her. She was blonde and  wore a black hoodie and Lululemon leggings with black Hokas. I couldn't take my eyes off her. And the whole time, there was this strong desire to do something about it. To masturbate. To store it for later so I had something to think about when I got home. 

It's made me think a lot about the world I've missed out on by being so addicted. I've seen it as so normal, as a way of relieving stress or getting ready for bed or even just an escape for spiritual fantasies in things I feel unfilfilled by. In changing that, I feel like I'm about to experience love, especially sexual intimacy, as something that *doesn't have to be dealt with* and can just exist. At least, I'm hoping for that. And I'm hoping it changes my relationship with people, from looking for things to put into the spank bank to cultivating real intimacy, and also to stop being afraid of the intimacy I have with my family.

I think I'm overeating as withdrawals. Really trying anything to curb the temptations to masturbate or play video games

It was weird hanging with family last night and realizing how attached to phones we've become. I didn't know how to socialize with anyone, having been so reliant on my phone to fill the gap. And I watched everyone laser focused on the games on their phones instead of talking. Especially the kids. 

The process of growth always seems to feel in a way like detachment. Like at first, it's an attempt to separate yourself from those around you. Sometimes it takes an ego trick, like attempting to feel superior to them by treating yourself or your objectives as better, to kickstart it all. Like I begin now to really see how disorganized my mom is, or scared my dad is. Not in a like negative or resentful way, but in the sense that I know where I got those things from. Growing up here means distancing myself from those habits and allowing those to be a part of who I am publicly. 

I feel myself trying to become more of a man now. Maybe it's the perpetual horniness, but all I want is to smell like wood, be jacked, and have so much sex.

I don't need her to believe me. I don't need her to believe me. I don't need her to believe me for me to be valid. For my life to be valid. For my adversity to be valid.

Why do I want so badly for her to agree with me?

Because I need to be right. Because I want to fuck her so I need to say whatever it takes to win her over. Because if she doesn't agree with me then I'm invalid. Because if she, a beautiful women, doesn't validate me then no women will. **Because she mirrors my younger self and I'm trying to explain to her what I would've told myself, and I'm frustrated that I can't get through to her.** I'm fucking frustrated that I can't stop her from going the same way I did. From following the life that someone else set out for her. From being deluded into thinking money is everything. Money can't solve your heartbreak. Money won't stop a bear from attacking you. More money can't fix the pain you feel. You're a selfish fucking prick and the world will show that to you one way or another. 

It still doesn't fully explain the insecurity I feel.

I think it's like...if I can't prove to a 19 year old that I'm sure of what I'm doing, then am I doing the right thing? Resistance I believe. Idk. An 8 year old would think it's cool. An 80 year old would think it's brave. I think it's like that fear of going to the gym In a way. Someone who actually goes to the gym would cheer you on. You're only judged by the people who do nothing. She complains about the cold in 60 degree weather. So why should I care what she thinks? If she wants to complain about her feet hurting at Starbucks then let her. 

I think part of it is it feels like she's trying to control my beliefs. I defy the paradigm in her world of what it means to be successful and be happy, and I think it makes her uncomfortable. It feels like she's trying to put her beliefs onto me and i don't like being controlled that way. It feels like she's "trying to understand" but really just trying to convince and I hate that. Or maybe that's what I'm doing. I think I want her to like me, and for some reason it feels like the disagreement gets in the way. 

It feels frustrating and I'm holding onto it for whatever reason. 

It's like I need her to believe me. Or I need everyone to believe me. To believe in me. To understand me. Because then I don't have to deal with my own insecurities. Like I can stop them from running into the thorns by telling everyone to stop instead of removing the thorn. 

I want to let this go.

I think what I feel is guilt. For who I was when I was her age, and how I pushed so many people away by trying to convince them to be a part of my model. And I'm trying to save her from that as a way of fixing what happened to me. Because the loneliness I experience now has a lot to do with the way I treated people then.

There's two girls talking next to me. One is a runner, goes to the gym, extroverted, etc. why do I feel weird wanting to talk to them? Like eavesdrop and self-inclusion? Where did we develop this idea of privacy where people don't intrude on public conversations? Like I feel like the highest version of myself has no social barrier. Maybe it's the intention? Like they're beautiful.

There's a heightened sense of attraction almost constantly. I wonder if this is how others feel almost all the time. Like it makes sense why it would be easier for someone else to risk rejection if this is what they always feels like.

It's intriguing wondering what life may look like on the other side of this. Like has my "betrayal" mindset been a guilt from masturbation? Like was it tha way with Taylor and Jess? Forbidden fruit kind of thing? Has my life situation been reinforced over and over every time I've indulged in the fantasies? Has the numbness been much larger than I'd thought? Has my emotional turbulence in relationships been because it's the only time I wasn't numb, and didn't know how to handle those feelings? I wonder what the answer to all those questions might be. I immediately feel attracted to so may more peple

Even now, I feel that attraction that used to be reserved for relationships. Like that feeling the day after having sex with someone the first time. I feel it for a lot of people today. I want to kiss them all. I feel great love for them all. Is this what everyone else feels?

I think the way it works with the taboo stuff is it normalizes it. Like I wouldn't have to worry anymore about the way a family member kissing me would make me feel, because no longer would that mean I'd have to act on it. The discomfort of love would become normal and detached from sex.

It is interesting almost looking at the underlying urge in public. It's not the macrophilia so much as just being close to those body parts. Almost a childish way of undressing 

Put in other words: we were standing in line for an Amazon return. She must've been 23 at least. Indian, with black leggings, sparkly silver shoes, a black and white striped shirt with brown elbow pads, and a black puffy vest. Through the leggings, you could see the outlines of her buttcheeks. And when I looked at her shoes, I imagined at first I was under her feet. She knew I was down there. But she acted like it was nothing. The old fantasy from online came to mind of the Indian woman who cauterized the mini guy into her foot. But this woman was just playing with me. The more I looked at her, the less it was that. I'd look around her vagina and became her thong. Looked around her breasts and became her bra. The longer I looked, the less involved I was. It was more the feet, the breasts, the vagina, than it was about me being apart of it. Just mentally undressing her Like I'd imagined other people would do. I just wanted to desperately to see her feet, her thong, her bra, much moreso than I wanted the other things. To see her, and truly see her. She was beautiful. And to feel her.

That feeling of a new relationship is kinda huge now. Like an ever present feeling of excitement towards going in laying in bed as if I was coming home to having sex. Has everyone else felt this the whole time?

I'm only now beginning to realize the strength of this addiction.
