# Week Num: Theme

Recovery week. Had the week off from Starbucks so took the entire week recovering from the fallout caused by E-Myth and The Practice. Finally beginning to stabilize.

In spite of the burnout, my habits carried me this week. I started out continuing to run, meditate, journal, and casually practice. Opening up the week, there was alot of concern around generosity and the views I'd previously held about it. It was a manipulation tactic meant for transactional relationships. Although I had spent much time delving into generosity I realize looking back that I had become the thing I was terrified of and was using generosity as a tool rather than giving to give.

I let myself sink further and further this week into a treacherous depression. Diet became terrible. There were many days where I didn't exercise and spent the day between video gaming, compulsively drumming, masturbating, eating poorly, and observing all of this. I felt guilty and apathetic, often looking for ways to deepen my suffering. Punishing myself for giving too much away. I'm still working to understand why, but it seems like in an effort to become more generous, I slipped back into people pleasing. I gave away what I didn't have and abandoned my Self in the process. And the phrase I kept coming back to was "If I only give to them, then who is giving to me?" And therein lies the crux of the issue. Its a dual issue of giving solely from a place of self-sacrifice and lacking gratitude for the role others play in my life.

The more of Pandora's box I opened, the more issues I'd seen. It wasn't one specific thing, but the myriad of issues I'd been working on overtime resurfacing into this amalgamation of pain, suffering and hopelessness. Fears I'd never find love. Feeling like I always had to be the one in control or nothing gets done. Fears I'd never be able to leave Starbucks or make any money. Feeling like I had the mold the world when I was the one who needed help. That it's all pointless anyways, so why even try. That I'm walking a path of isolation and loneliness and it will always be this way.

At the center of all this has been trying to understand "who's it for?" A debilitating question from The Practice which has reshaped my entire creative identity. At the core, I think the issue has been a misunderstanding. The idea that you could make art for someone else, while generous, touches on the large thorn in my life surrounding working for and giving towards others. And that if I started making for someone else, who is making for me? It's always been a safe space for me, and if all the sudden I'm doing it for others then it feels like I'm being robbed of something, maybe the only thing, that heals me. I concluded the week finally delving into the resentment being stored towards myself for the ways I'd abandoned myself again. 

## Achievements

1. Got to a core issue revolving around the question "Who's it for"
2. Recovered from burnout
3. Returned to a place of at least wanting peace

## Friction

1. Giving to recieve instead of giving to give
2. Cold weather causing me to regress in diet. Need to focus on this
3. Devitated WAY too far from mental health work
4. Giving with nothing to give results in self-sacrifice
5. Spent too much time focusing on trying to get to peace instead of actually doing things which would bring peace. Like meditating, reading a book at a coffee shop, taking part in new experiences. This is self-love. Not torturing yourself over "mental health work" which is just mindless rants. That said, this week desparately needed most of those emotions exorcised. But there should've been a greater balance
6. Spent way too much money (giving more than I had to give)
7. In doing the mental health work this week, I couldve spent more time understanding the small payoffs I was getting from being so low and things like ungenerous
8. Lack of willpower and creativity has made it hard to imagine a future to work towards. Can't tell if its a symptom of or proponent of the hopelessness.
9. Not actually shipping any products
10. Without future plans or willpower, no desire to grow socially. Pushing me towards isolation
11. Completely eroded self trust from misaligned intentions
