# Week 43

I neglected my reviews the past couple week. In part, an act of personal
negligence, but also recalibration. In beginning to grow my business, I read
E-Myth, The Practice, Million Dollar Weekend. The conjunction of all of them
sent me spiraling for the past few weeks as I've been struggling to find solid
ground. The combined effects of these books taught me much about generosity and
the selfish nature I both live in and feel surrounded by. This has thrown me
into a deep and hopeless depression, recognizing everything I had once dreamed
was still selfishly motivated primarily as a means to an end. In full
transparency, I stood over a bridge on a semi-suicidal night, never seriously
contemplating the end but thinking it would be a "solution" to the suffering I
was experiencing. The worst part of all of it was that I only talked with
ChatGPT about the whole thing, replacing genuine human interaction with it. 

I don't see this as a bad thing, but it's been difficult finding any motivation
knowing that the idea I once thought of as mastery now feels like an outcome
which only seeks to benefit myself. Trying to shift my world view to one of
unexpecting, favorless, and transactionless generosity is proving to be
difficult. Even moreso, reconciling the life I want to live with what other
people value, and doing so with an increasing structural integrity, is driving
me crazy. It's so different from the life I've lived so far. Also from the
lives of everyone I feel surrounded by.

The major component of all this is a complete reshaping on my view of the
purpose of creation, curiosity, structure, and art. My previous thoughts were
of creation, especially the shipping of art, as a form of self-expression
exclusively. The idea was that if you promoted yourself and your work
authentically, an audience naturally emerged. There is truth to this, but my
approach to this view point is based on the idea of serving an unknown
assailant, the "everyone" instead of "someone," and has been approached without
right intention. Mastery was a means of financial security and opportunity. The
business I was working towards was purely financially motivated. Structure was
a limitation on the freedom of creativity. And finally, that art should be free
and that if I made it for me, others would enjoy it. 

Now, I view these intentions as selfish and limiting. 

When I watch *Seinfeld* now, I think about how it was made by not just one
artist, but writers, actors, directors, cameramen, and so many other artists
all working in tandem. They needed structure for each and every one of them to
work at maximum capacity. Maybe there was limitations because of that, but the
show thrived because there was some underlying structure which allowed every
artist to fill their role. Look how many episodes came because of that! I've
been laughing at the show all morning. The intention of the show was to give
the gift of laughter to an identifiable audience. If the show didn't make
someone laugh or feel the way they were meant to, it's not impactful art. Or
it's just unrealistic. And in the vein, curiosity was a result of exploring
*within* the structure they made.

It all started with Jerry Seinfeld learning how to make one person laugh. A
single person that he's given this gift to. A comedian who can only make
themself laugh would not have a very successful career.

I think the point I'm getting at is that the *value* of art lies in its ability
to make a lasting impact. A change. It doesn't have to solve the world's
problems, but I think it's meant to make us feel something. And if it's making
us feel something either than what was intended, that's a reflection of the
artist's abilities. The iterative process of trying, shipping, failing,
improving, and repeating is what develops the intuition and makes better art.
But that improvement only comes from making an intention in the first place and
then measuring it against how the people its meant for respond. 

I'm tired of ranting this. Here's the summary for the week:

---

Began the week with finally hitting my first difficult race goal. In reaching this goal, I reflected alot on the purpose of finite goals with structure. Doing so with all I had learned from E-Myth sent me into a tailspin. I spent the next few days recovering from this race while diving deeper into a sinkhole. All of my structures began falling apart. Hope was lost. Yet I remained dilligent. Each day, I still found my way to the kit, to the practice...until I got to actually reading The Practice. The insights of this book created an unimaginable discomfort. I had to confront the reality of my selfishness, and the role it played in the art that I created. I began seeing the world in a whole new way, driven by structured creativity everywhere. This created confusion, chaos, and conflict in my Self as all I'd learned gradually chipped away at the dreams I had before. I began viewing the path I was building as having transitioned from a need for fame and attention, to a need for money, to not knowing at all what my vision for the future was. 

I sit now in the ashes of these flames. Despite all the turmoil I suffered, I sit here with hope. My awareness has expanded. While I still feel a sense of dread, I see what I've learned as having opened a new world. *The Practice* masterfully captured all the topics in Principles, Million Dollar Weekend, $100m offers, and E-Myth in a way that hasn't resonated with me before. That generoisty, the work we do for others without expectation of an outcome, is at the core of all art. That ultimately, art is one of the biggest proponents of progress. 

I ended the week attending Juan "Carlito" Mendoza's drum clinic. This clinic showed me many things, but among them being the power of surrounding yourself with people on the same journey. The books I've read and the concepts about art I've learned created much conflict between those I work with and thoe I play with. But amongst the drumming community, I was able to talk about all I've been learning. Generosity came from taking videos of Juan's performance and sending them to him so that he could post it (whether or not he does is up to him). Or even just listening to Jason talk. I felt more at home with people that knew more than me than I ever do with those who have no similar interests, which is something I've scarcely experienced. Being surrounded by drum teachers, entreprenuers, giggers, and learners felt so humbling. It's given me a new vision for who I want to surround myself with and how to get there. 

## Achievements

1. Ran my first 10 mile!
2. Attended Juan's workshop (he followed me on insta!)
3. Read The Practice
4. Implemented a rudimentary version of the app

## Friction

- Constantly overspending, overeating, and overmasturbating, and overindulging. I definitely think it's a consequence of all the turmoil I've felt recently, but also lack of exercise (from rest week) has me falling back on old habits. I've also not been taking care of diet, so that's been frustrating.
- Falling back on old habits in times of duress
- DIET DIET DIET
- Still working at Starbucks
- No sense of direction from books, still realigning
- People I surround myself are not aligned with long-term growth. Their beliefs on things like structure, money, and creativity are aligned with the ways which I used to think about these things. So my growth is now somewhat ostracising me from the tribe
- Not logging all food
- Not paying attention to budgets
- Didn't do reviews for weeks, so I wasn't rewarding myself for my accomplishments or recognizing friction or even just seeing growth during times of stress
- Don't trust myself to take on bigger gigs, higher paying clients, or even just students. Restricting my development to what I'm comfortable with rather than what could benefit people
- Obsession with structureless growth/Fear of structured growth. Not only in my own development, but in the sense of abiding by someone else's structure which I may not understand. A fear or distrust that I have what it takes to conform to someone else's structure. Eg taking a job at a lesson's company where my value is determined by them and my potential is capped by them. Eg auditioning for and playing as someone else's drummer. Eg being in a relationship.
- Being picky about who I serve instead of serving anyone and everyone who may need me
- Using skillset and predilections as a way to avoid helping people or becoming more generous.

The ONE Thing?

I would say it's a community thing. All of the things I struggle with seem to be ways that I'm still surrounded by people unaligned with me. They don't take care of diet, they aren't entreprenuers, aren't adventurous or courageous. Like all the ways I want to develop now are at the brim of what people I work with and play with find to be comfortable. I can better them only by getting away from them. In other words, finding a better community is HOW I serve them. 

So I have to think about how I'm going to address this.
