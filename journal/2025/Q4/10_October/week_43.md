What does it mean/look like to connect deeply with people outside of their
struggles? Is it what I previously interpreted as connection as just being
trauma bonding? Like it makes me feel like I'm drawn to their negativity and
drama way outside of anything else and don't know how to connect without those
things. Like Josh for instance, most positive guy I know, I don't know how to
connect with him some times because I anticipate the negative

Instead of loans, roll on reverse. Put that money to compound in savings and
outright buy the care when necessary

Even willingness to give compliments comes from generosity

 Everything with generosity right now is kind of plaguing my mind and it's
something that I wonder if it isn't just that I'm focused so much on myself
right now that I'm not feeling it's generous you know cause I'm at work and
there's a lot of times where I'm good at complementing people at work, but it's
always kind of like a vulnerability like a risk kind of thing and I think
lately I haven't been doing it partly because I don't want to engage with
certain people that tend to bring my energy down, but also I don't know it just
doesn't feel like a risk. I'm really willing to take and so I'm kind of at a
loss with all of the generosity stuff. Like it's definitely the same discomfort
that has surfaced in my lifetime and time again when dealing with other
changes, but it seems like the only way to get better about is to give and I
don't really know what I have to give and maybe that's like the heart of it
right now. Like I don't really feel like I've developed any kind of muscle for
generosity and I think I'm constantly thinking about it as a money thing and
when people you know are trying to be generous with me I feel like I'm taking
advantage of them and I don't really know where that starts from but you know
it happened with Amy in the car stuff and then it happened with this week like
with him Josh offering to pay for my races or whatever I think it's hard
because you know people around me are starting to make more money at least like
the people I look at and pay attention to like they're growing financially, and
I'm still where I am and it's good because they're inspiring me to do more, but
I even in trying to make more money. I'm running into the same issue of
generosity makes me anxious you know giving makes me anxious and I'm like
scared to do it even when it does make me feel better you know I just feel like
I'm super self-centered you know and it's like it's frustrating when I bring up
all the motions around it. It's just a lot of frustration and I think it's
because I know intuitively that I should be willing to give more and I'm not
and it even reflected back on myself you know in the way that I treat myself.
Like if I look at it from Josh's perspective like if I were in his shoes and
someone told me they couldn't afford it my instinct isn't oh, I would pay for
you total. It would be 00 I'm sorry that sucks for you and it feels like that's
another way. I avoid connection. It's like even the times that I am willing to
do it. It's always with some kind of a ulterior motive, and I feel guilty about
that because I don't really know how to do. It not transactionally in a way
that doesn't bring up these feelings of guilt. You know I think the more I dig
into growth in this career. I'm trying to build the more I see that all of it
surrounded by the active generosity you know it's constantly giving knowledge
to people or lessons to people or teaching people you know giving people a job
giving money to organizations or even just other people I'm working With, but I
can't anticipate anyone wanting to give anything to me because I don't really
feel like I'm giving them anything in return. Like another thing I think about
is working with Caleb or any of the Florence Cardigan guys is like if they're
gonna bring me on or even help me record stuff or if anyone's gonna help me
record anything it's like I'm just taking advantage of them and I feel guilty
about it because I feel like I owe them and I feel like all of this is
something I need to sit with and begin to understand like OK how can I get
better at my generosity? You know how can I improve in this aspect so I can
connect with more people and give more people things but it's like it's the
whole projection thing where because I act this way I anticipate other people
acting this way like I don't wanna give anyone anything because I don't want
people to feel like they owe me for something or even then I want them to owe
me for something like if that if I'm being truthful, I'm giving to get most of
the time I'm giving because I want something in return and it's not even like a
small scope thing like they'll be people that I constantly give give to because
I want something from them and I tend to choose the people who are in my circle
based on that kind of principle not necessarily like about connection or good
vibes or anything it's like what can you do for me in the long run and it kind
of sickens me and talking all this out I know now how much I need to sit with
this.

Music journey should inevitably be directed towards creating songs on different
genres

The depths of my generosity problems are starting to reveal themselves. I've
been finding more and more recently that I've responded to people with "I can't
afford it" instead of working to make it work. Like Jennifer with fitness and
Josh with the race and with Christmas coming up all the gifts and Mu with
medications. Yet I'm eager to jump at things like books, vacations, food, or
other like simple priorities. Not only that, but I recognize now more and more
the depths of the discomfort around others generosity. Like when Josh offered
to pay for my running, job offers from friends, really receiving any help from
anyone else. Even asking friends to play my music with me. The discomfort is
akin to the ones that came up when I changed masturbation habits and also
started eating grapes, so I know it's just the discomfort of change. Still, how
do I improve on this? In a way that I can actually feel the generosity and move
past this issue? Because when I begin to look through the eyes of success, it's
about constant generosity. Give give give and one day youll open the gap wide
enough to receive. Like teaching lessons, instead of exchanging services, is
about giving an overwhelmingly positive experience that's incredibly fruitful
for any that come. Focusing on that part makes it so much easier, but it's what
I'm most uncomfortable with. Leading a camping trip is about *giving*
direction. I feel like the more I can lean into the act of generosity and
overcome this fear and discomfort around it, the better my life will be

Grow slow and steadily, at the pace you're comfortable with. Big leaps aren't
required. Small adjustments that compound over time are

Talking it out with Amanda and Russ has brought a lot of anger and discomfort
out. Reasonably so, it's brought it out within me too. It's coming to my
attention that part of the difficulty I have is that I'm around people who make
this seem like a bad thing, and always have been around those people.

Something I've been coming back to is that I think my approach to the business,
marketing, or even just helping people is tantamount to my approach to
relationships. I'm not seeking to be apart of something so much as I'm trying
to force the world to act like me. Trying to control, manipulate, and change
instead of truly understand.

Collaborative album? Bring to life music from all different types of
songwriters. All I would need is a producer willing to work on all of it. Kinda
like Jesse's thing but as a drummer.

I am really starting to believe that I'm being super selective about who gets
to benefit from my services

All this new stuff is making me aware of just how antagonistic my coworkers
are, and that they may now be a big reason I feel held back by my desires to
grow

It seems like the idea is that you get to choose what you want to do, not
necessarily who you do it for or who it serves AS AN OUTCOME. That is the
mindset of a professional.

The factor you have control over is in finding the people you want it to impact
AND the change you want to make in them (eg bring them joy) and use an
iterative process of feedback and refinement from these people to give them AND
ONLY THEM the best experience. Trusting in this process and yourself is what
grows the audience. It works best when those people you serve are real people
too. 

And so the best thing that you can do as a professional is always serve to the
greatest capacity. Serve the sound engineer by having a great sound. Serve the
other bandmates by practicing, learning the music, and etc. serve the crowd by
finding the music that will give them the best experience possible while also
striving for creative quality. But how do you do this in a way that isn't
self-sacrificing?

I'm starting to understand it now. It's not about just making whatever you want
you know I think you can write from a place of inspiration or emotion and fact
you always should but deport important part of art is to help someone to
connect with someone you know when you're writing a song, it's about writing
something that other people can relate to other people could experience as
well. When you paint a painting, it's about making an impact or even just
making a room a little bit nicer. Like you can write a song or paint a painting
for yourself but at the end of the day it has to be of some service to someone
else who's gonna want listen and so it's about figuring out who does that art
serve. And I mean that starts with a local community you know when you think
about going to a show or playing one it's about who are the five people that no
matter what you do they're going to show up and then creating a show that is
for those people I think I've been so caught up on the idea of like artistic
integrity that I haven't been willing to I guess create something that helps.
And I think it all started when I made this video like this video was an
emotional video, but it was intended for people that can't go to school for
music or need inspiration and want to start their own journey and the entire
purpose of it is for that and the whole series is for that and you know it
impacted someone.  In that regard, most selfish thing you can do as an artist
is to make art for yourself that serves yourself and unexpected to or expect
other people to want to pay for that

And who the work is in service to is a large part of the structure

I also think before it was about posting for affirmation. Under Seth's
framework, it's about posting as a gift. I go back to this one thing he said:
it's about giving the right people the right things at the right time over the
right medium and letting them choose whether or not to engage.

What if my organization, the change I seek to make, isn't a business so much as
a blueprint for successful and authentic musicians? Like if I document my
process for growth and teach it to others like Jackson?

The idea of like intentionally creating something while remaining authentic is
starting to make sense. It's not about limiting creation so much as creating
constantly and filtering the means and intentionality to the platform that that
audience is catered to. For example, the difference between creating for
YouTube, writing on Substack, and writing music. For YouTube, Jackson is my
audience right now and the goal of that platform is to inspire him. This is
because Jackson goes to YouTube and watches videos there. For Substack, I don't
yet have an audience, but feel like I should look for people who enjoy the
platform and post thoughts there that are genuine but cater to them. Inspire or
help them. And I think it's learning to create these feelings consistently
regardless of how I feel. How is that done without masking? Maybe it's not
about masking so much as the process of editting that can shape any emotion
into another one?

I feel like last night I had this sort of epiphany moment. It makes sense why
group dynamics are something I fear, and generosity, because I think all of my
life I've been surrounded by situations, groups (scouts, church), and people
(Haley, Jess, Amy) where most forms of giving were met with rejection and
resulted in self-erasure. Not necessarily on their end, but as a response. The
depths of it all was clearer last night. It's a very big issue.

Need to get back on weekly reviews. Having not done them is driving me crazy.

Marketing for solo musicians (that are already big) #ideas #business

The difficult part that I've neglected with my goal setting is actually sitting around and understanding the changes that need to be made, then following through with honest intentions. I think it's part of the self trust thing which makes it a self fulfilling prophecy of not taking these goals I set for myself seriously. Like the diet thing for instance...it's not that I haven't followed through, it's that there are parts of the plan that I haven't committed to specifically enough AND there's a lack of attention to the three month plan. I should be totally clear that these are failures ALONG THE WAY. They aren't due to negligence so much as unsustainable practices.

The diet thing for instance is multifaceted where the issue was building a habit inconsistent with how I operate. I'm not around my phone enough to operate it, and my diet frequently has been circumstantial. My most recent attempt assumes that the issue is the quality of the food I eat, taking more time to cook meals rather than eating out constantly. And the other component of it is being around so many people who don't pay attention to diet, so there are no healthy reminders around me and it requires constant willpower to stick out like that.

I think another element of this is relating it to focus. I think in the past, I've been so unaware of long term goals that the signal to noise ratio has been high. This also seems to be from a lack of structure and commitment. I think maintaining a stronger awareness, or really dilligence, to what I set out to do months in advance will both better educate the kinds of goals I need to be setting and further strengthen the ones I'm building.

So for instance, I think right now the most important thing I can be doing is continuing to focus on the bigger goals I've set for myself for 3 month periods without inflating them. The business habit, the half marathon, and the jazz proficiency. In a month, and in three months, I can adjust what I need to. But much like in meditation, changes do NOT need to be made right away. It's better to think on them. There's a lot of excitement in immediate change, but also a lot of floundering. Trust that the best ideas will strengthen over time. So focus on structure and management. Use entrepreneurial ship to make more energy and more time.

I see now. To the warrior, there's no good or bad. There is only a challenge. To the warrior, teaching kids in the area is just a challenge. To the warrior, posting everyday is just a challenge. To the warrior, finding new friends is just a challenge.
