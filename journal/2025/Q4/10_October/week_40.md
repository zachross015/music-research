It's not just business. My life is plagued by a lack of follow through

Resistance to posting online is multifaceted:
- Not giving myself any reward for doing so (Fake points or anything) for intrinsic reward
- fear of criticism or consequence
- Fears of looking like a fake
	- Mostly rooted in "impressing" JJ

I need MORE lessons as R&D

Content bands?

One of the twisted jokes of life is the hedonic principle. Because we get used to anything--from diet to environment--we must constantly be changing, reinventing. It's a beautiful reminder that we are not robots, but ever evolving creatures who must be creative and adaptive in order to survive. I learn this lesson over and over again when attempting to systemize and understand routine.

Infinite content engine:
- Pick a song
- Fuse two genres and play what it would sound like

What are the systems that need to be developed to facilitate this?

Teach how to use practice as an R&D lab

Organize all known exercises

"Developing a Practice Strategy"
- Notes on defining a practice to reach intended goal. How can we begin to understand what is accomplishable in a given set of practices? What metrics are good for certain goals?
- What are intended goals?
	- Learn a song
	- Get a fill or groove to a specific tempo
	- Refine the feeling of a section 
So what do I need?
- Sit down and come up with systems to improve all of this

It's like the newer vision that I feel most passionate about is being almost a documentarian of my journey exploring music while also having a home base operation that is like a music lab for learning, practicing, and exploring drums with other people

I feel like the more I zoom out now the more wrong I see how much I've done a lot of things I've been doing and how little they've actually been I guess benefiting me cause when I look at like what I'm doing and ask like what is the business I don't have any kind of a solid answer. It feels like spreading myself between multiple directions you know between a performer, a session person and a lessons teacher and I don't really know which one to focus on or how to build a business out of it or really just how to say like what is it? What is the business of a musician? It all it really points to is like I need to get organized. Like what is the ideal scenario here? What do I even want anymore? The only things that ring true is that I want to be able to create music and I want to be able to give people the experience that I used to have playing drums. Or the escape I got from it. And it's like my head is just turning turning turning now because like I don't know what I want anymore you know like the things that I wanted when I start this journey are so different and it keeps changing. It's hard to want to build anything because I have this like belief that once I try to center it on a single idea then I'm just going to want to change it and then I'm gonna be miserable in the life I'm leading it's like right now. I don't even have any like desire desires to hike or camp. I mean, I want to do those things but it's not like the main thing like I guess all my focus right now is on building a business and it's like I don't feel like I have time for anything else and maybe that's just me not treating myself low enough I think that could be a big part of it because I mean those desires haven't really changed but now it's like when I imagine my future it's in like this modern Sheek house you know I keep thinking about that fantasy of like I'm playing a gig and my wife and kids are dancing on the Lawn and we come home and she puts the kids to bed or she says mommy needs some alone time with daddy and watches them run up to the room and she just jumps on me after that but I guess it's like I'm trying to figure out what my primary name is you know if I really boil it down like what is it that I want life to look like and I feel like I've asked this many times but it's been refined overtime like as I've been more connected to people it's gotten better, but it went from playing like sold out shows in like in front of millions of people to just like you know being quaint wholesome, and it's like I don't know my mind is brewing with opportunity. It's like I want to do so many things now and it's like I feel like with where I'm going with drums I could it's just I feel like I have to pick and that's driving me crazy like I want to rationalize a business that works with gigs with recordings with teaching, but I feel like maybe it's not one business you know maybe it's picking up a couple

I think the best way of putting it is I have no like genuine strategy you know the more I think about it the more I'm just like I'm just doing shit to try and like grow social media numbers but even that is like nothing you know it means nothing, especially to me. I'm not growing a business. I'm just playing practicing posting. You know there's no there's nothing that all this is working towards. It's just very tactical in the moment like this is what I'm doing. This is what it feels like it needs and I think for a long time that's been what I've known how to do you know and I think it's all based on this limiting belief I've had that like I don't like order or I don't like systems or control or anything like I like the ability to move freely, but I feel like that has been constraining me because when I think about the idea of the system, it's point is for like efficient improvement you know efficient growth like a plan. I mean, you know still pay attention like still be aware, but like I'm not frustrated about any of this I'm just I'm like ecstatic I'm I'm excited. I'm overjoyed to have an answer to this question that I've been struggling with for so long which is like why is this taking so long? Why is it so slow and it's just because I don't know what I'm doing I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish and I definitely don't have anything in place to make sure I get it there, but I don't have anything in place because like there's no objective I feel like this book is making me like be hyper aware of like what is it? I'm trying to accomplish like what do I want it to look like it feels right and I think the fact that there's no one answer right now kind of means that I am just flip-flopping and I really need to take some time to just sit down. Take a step back and understand what am I trying to do like what is it that 1020 years down the one I could do every day for the rest of my life

Jamming with Spare Change has made me realize that 
1. I have absolutely no idea how to control or move with energy
2. They don't know much about soloing or listening

The metronome and the recording are the tools to measuring our intentions against reality.

The version 

He's got this grace about him. There's a great strength you can sense with him, but you wouldn't be able to tell on the offset. He's intimidating, but gentle. I felt welcomed at our first lesson like I was being taken in the arms of a giant and cradled. He asked a lot of me and expects a lot of me, but I can tell it's because he sees something in me that no one else has.

I'm beginning to understand that a great teacher can be gentle and stern at the same time.

How strong of a structure and order can I build that still permits spontaneity and improv?

The systems that divine my practice routine: two excessively then do it with purpose, find the one thing to work on approach every practice with intention, consistency, above all else,

The thing that differentiate you differentiate what you're playing from what everyone else is playing is most commonly that you were playing four different instruments 4 instruments with four completely different historical significances at any point in time each of them put together to improve well pocket is almost always defined as your ability to play with other people I think in a much deeper sense it is how cohesive you work with yourself how the different parts of your mind communicate with each other to form a symbolic hole how each limb is able to very intentionally be placed in perfect execution with another Webb it's for this reason that being a good listener is so important to drama. You're listening to everyone, but to keep a steady tempo you have to be able to listen to yourself to trust yourself enough to play each part both independently and as a whole. It's my understanding the resistance is to this kind of unification that you begin to peace by peace let go of them and fall more into the flow of drumming may encounter many different kinds of resistance, technical ability, timekeeping, ability, listening, ability, and many more, but with each piece, you learn each new technique you build up her begin to master you're able to become more ingrained in the flow of reality than ever before that to me is the essence of drumming, when even on your own, you can be in the pocket and especially when you play with other people can begin to see how your peace is just a small part of a much bigger hole learning different genres is the best way to understand what part drumming is and what part drumming isn't

Because of all this, the metronome is the most important tool at your disposal. It's the proverbial target to hit beyond just an annoying click in the background. It's your tool for understanding you're under your grass of time and how well you're able to be present with it and feel the rhythm of life emanating through you from amor technical standpoint your ability to actually hit what you intend to hit to do what you say you're intending to do so that when it comes to play with other people when you understand exactly what their part is you know how exactly to lineup what you're playing with what they're playing the purpose of a metronome is not to get perfect timing, but to understand where you fit and how to consistently fit there

Drum group classes designed around what I'm interested in learning #ideas #business

I look around now and the experience I want to provide is that akin to that really nice restaurant in The Bear. Like a set of systems so carefully orchestrated that anyone who joins will fit in seamlessly and feel so inspired to be a part of it that they can't help but grow, but also to have such a high standard of quality that it brings out the best in others. It also makes me aware of just how how important systems are, and how much I've neglected them. The only way to bring order to this business is to first bring order to my mind and systems

Business should reak of constant growth

Buccees sells comfort. Going into the store, I begin to see the information from the book. Whoever made Buccees didn't just make the store. It made a prototype for how they create an infinite chain of them. Every position is so well thought out to make the place reek of comfort and efficiency, even in such a highly complex system. They welcome you, all the food is southern comfort, even the bathroom stalls have cement separators so that small discomfort of peeing too close to someone is gone. THAT is what it means to consider "it" in all the decision making. To understand what "it" is you are selling, and to bring that to each and every decision in the process. Like when there is some concern or common problem with all of the customers, or even just feedback, or even an efficiency issue, that the solution has "it" baked in as a core ingredient

I want direction, purpose, and focus to be part of the mission


Or program or system to the lessons that we would offer should be an almost algorithmic way to turn what someone is hoping to accomplish and into like a dedicated plan you know so that a teacher can go in ask like what is your goal then shape out a plan that just will almost like 99% guarantee that they make it so long as they follow the plan and like keep up with like weekly lessons and stuff something like that and I think it should abide by a system of like assumed diligence assuming that they would practice every day but have enough tolerance to say that you know if they miss one or two days then they should be fine but the ultimate thing is we wanna pump out good quality excellent quality maybe not even quality to the point of like good performance, although that be good but to pump out people who feel like they've accomplished something every time they come in and feel like their dreams have been heard and they've been giving a plan that will realize them

Most progress comes from gaining an awareness over an outcome and finding a way to neutrally label it. By that standard, all progress becomes an unconscious process 

We exist in the pocket as a rusher or a drag or reflects how we approach presence you know if if we're living too far in the future, we tend to rush if we're living too far in the past, we tend to drag refining your ability to play at exactly the right time requires you to understand where you live in the spectrum

A true growth is not about getting 1% better every day. It's about learning what it takes to get one percent better every day and truly understanding what that means you know cause getting 1% better is not always possible with some of the constraints that we either put on ourselves or our lives put on us so it means often times changing everything to create a structure for yourself that makes it possible to continue growing every day but keep that lightweight all of that right now for me is with this idea of business. It's like you know I've hit a point where I'm growing in drums, but I don't know if I'm growing one person every day and the kind of changed that I would need to grow one person every day requires me to completely rethink of the entire structure that I'm using to achieve the goals. I want to achieve and from the financial perspective of growing a business it means completely changing the way I operate my business to be more strategic.

What are the rules for my rehearsals? The systems that make them efficient? What about gigs? Lessons? Overarching plans? Songwriting?

Do it slow first. Build the system later, after observing what you already do

Something I've been thinking about today is that like, I feel like my unstructured lifestyle falls from some kind of fear of structure. A claustrophobic feeling. But things like Runna make me aware of just how beneficial that kind of structure is for achieving goals. I think the awareness it creates is that the unstructured nature often falls from having no concrete objective, especially not a quantifiable one in a field like jazz. It's also this fear that by having structure I miss out on the lessons. Like if the intention is to meet an objective, then the focus is so heavily on that objective that I wouldn't learn. But that's not at all what I've learned from video games, Starbucks, bands, books, etc. The structure is the medium through which we learn

There's so much going through my head now. So many systems I want to write out that I'm having a hard time finding the space for it all. 

What is the system that takes me from meeting with a producer to becoming integral to their studio?

REI sells freedom and adventure. Their classes are like a huge part of the business, it makes them seem like they actually give a shit about things outside of selling. Guitar Center doesn't seem to do the same thing. Why? Is that an opportunity?

We are at Rhythmic, believe that the practice is part of the art itself. Our goal and endeavor is not specifically to improve better instrument, but to improve in general, we see practices away as refining who we are in the methods that we choose to practice shape our reality in our life from then on out that's why it is a Paramount importance to us that we abide by the rules that we place on ourselves, the restrictions that we replaced that help us to form or created IDs, these structures are not to restrict us in the sense of limiting us, but to challenge us to be creative in new ways to find new ways to re-create sounds and emotions given sense of order. It's not just about becoming better drummers but becoming better musicians, better listeners, and better people and using our practice as a time to challenge us and see which ways for which shapes or something like that.


Find a way to make them win every week create enough of a structure to meet them where they are at all points where to anticipate where they're trying to go and be ready to push them forward from there

My diligence to time and to being punctual to other people's events like a band practice or to work or anything like that is only a reflection of my own punctuality to myself. I think the reason I was late and have continued to be late to things like spare change rehearsals parking, garage gigs Israel gigs everything like that is due to my own commitment to time to myself and respect my own time. I don't respect it as is like visualized by the way that I structure my practices and my workouts and my meditations you know why there's this constant frustration with not being able to stick to my own time that I a lot for myself and not using that to educate myself to further improve the way I spend my time so I think it's really important to start doing that

I understand the rules part now. It's about writing out the rules and systems. I already abide by and telling other people if they're going to play the game then they have to follow the same set of rules and like a rule can be like no drinking on stage or at a performance or anything, you know, rules of professionalism and stuff like that and a system that I've been thinking about can be like song benchmarks like as you're listening to an album as if it's like a marketing call you know where people get caught up. Like rules for cleanliness as well

Need to really start recording or writing what Isra says about like phrasing around why he enjoys paying for my services over anyone else
