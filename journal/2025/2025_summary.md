## Summary

<!-- Summarize the year in 1000 characters or less. -->

This was the year of planted seeds and first steps. It began with intentions for social growth and learning jazz, and in doing so encountered much more. I'd hoped getting to the end of the year that I'd have run a marathon, fully departed from Starbucks, and found love, but life had other plans for me. Over the course of the year, I was consumed by dopamine addictions which were fueled by the grief of Andy and Jaida leaving Starbucks, attending to Mu's injury after her fight with Maddie, leaving Amy behind, and an obsession with Brandi (really, the Siren). Not dealing with the trauma of these circumstances led me to a suicidal state standing over a bridge, not seriously considering but wondering. But I survived. Through all the turmoil came greater strides than ever before. I ran my first 10 mile, planned a camping trip, cut out drama, recovered from the attachment issues which constantly contributed to my obsessions, attended my first jam session, quit Highway 49, started taking Music seriously, and connected with my Muse. Still, I was living in a unstable structure which burned to the ground after reading E-Myth and The Practice. From the ashes of this destruction, rose a stronger, more stable, structure. One that is equally capable of housing me and my desires as it will house others in the future. I leave the year with a greater understanding of my destination. I've lost the need to succeed and what's left is the desire to serve. I know now that being an architect is not only important, but mandatory, for building the life I'd like to live. I've given up all my dopamine addictions, knowing they only impede the life I want to live. 

### 3 Shifts I Witnessed in Myself

<!-- Take time to recognize the progress that has been made. Identify the biggest changes you've noticed -->
<!-- over the past year to the energy you carry, the connections you have to others, and any -->
<!-- other ways you've grown. -->

1. Approaching every part of life with more intentionality.
2. Greater self-care, not allowing loops to remain open even at a financial detriment and zero tolerance for drama.
3. Better understanding of the structure required to perservere in arduous circumstances.

#### Structures Built / Systems Strengthened

<!-- Continue this by noting the autonomous components of your growth. -->

1. Automated recording setup
2. Weekly meal prepping from a recipe book
3. Adopted coaches (eg Runna, PT)
4. Committed to long term financial growth by automating savings, credit payments, cutting down on subscriptions, and paying up front instea dof over time
5. Chore chart, strengthened to be prioritized every week

### Persistent Resistance

<!-- Write out the elements of friction which have persisted throughout all year. -->

1. Open loops.
2. Disorganized spaces with alot of residuals from a previous life that could be liquidated to better serve the present or given away. 
3. **Starting**. I put so much pressure on myself to be the best when I start instead of showing up for the first time imperfect, and all it makes happen is nothing. It applies as much to business as it does joining a community, and discounting community.
4. I just quit all the dopamine habits but I'm going to put here anyways: staying stuck with emotions and covering them up with addictions instead of working through them.

## Review

### The ONE Thing

<!-- Write out a diagnosis of the root problem that occurred between recurring frictions and -->
<!-- work to find the single, simplest action you can take (consistently) towards removing that issue. -->

I want to say it's a matter of priority? Maybe resistance. I feel like there will always be open loops, but will there always be disorganized spaces? Is being rigid to that important? Maybe it's the depth of those tasks in relation to priority? Like selling all that I don't need is a pretty big task. There's books I have to get rid of, stuff that isn't even mine, and alot of stuff I want to sell. It's as much a full time project as anything else. When I imagine the future, I imagine a clean house. An organized house. A structured house. Maybe OCD, but definitely good. Clean. Like when I do my laundry, it saves a little bit of time every day. What if that applied everywhere? What if the pursuit everyday is to shave minutes, seconds, off remedial tasks? To act like a fremen with water and preserve every drop of money, every drop of time. Every time I do that, clean out an unused project, I feel lighter. Cleaner. More proud of the space I occupy, and I walk taller. I don't think about it every time and so I get more done.

It's like this give and take. On one side, I could be coming up with things to do to distract me from my priorities. The other side is I could be making or saving time/money/space by clearing out all that isn't important. It's as much true in the secular world as it is in my head. If I can cleanse all of the unimportant components, then I can move with much more grace and much more free. The difficult part is that it feels like I'm using that as an excuse not to do the actual work for the business. 

I guess it feels like a practice in and of itself in the meantime. The practice of a clutter free mind or a clutter free life. The first step is just everyday commit to cleaning a little bit, and over time let that amount to something.

I know the focus of this year is business growth, but as a part of that, there needs to be an emphasis on equal parts growth and cutting out.

### Recommitment

The Year of Authority.

This is the year I take control of the places I've felt burdened by my position in life. I will no longer allow my life path as a drummer, musician, and artist, be an excuse or source of insecurity. No longer will I tolerate giving my time and energy to people or things who give nothing in return. I will no longer give in to Resistance. I will complete all I start.

I will fall in love. With my Self, with Music, and with my Muse. I will put myself into weekly networking opporutnities: jam sessions, rub clubs, and business networking events. I will put myself into monthly giving opportunities: charity organizations and live shows. I will surround my Self with people who inspire me, accept me, include me, and help me succeed. I will do the EXACT same for them. 

I will become adept at Afro-Cuban drumming. I will find a small ensemble of me, guitarist, pianist, and bassist by 4/1/2026. I will find my Muse by 6/29/2026. I will run the New York Marathon on 11/1/2026.

I will build my own studio. We will, as a small company, have a weekly throughput of 40 students at $75/hr with each student leaving each day feeling more and more connected to music and life itself. I will have a weekly blog on drum topics and spirituatliy.

### Goals for next year

1. Grow Rhythmic to serve 40 students a week
    - What it looks like: I woke up at 430 today. It's cold as fuck outside, but I'm meeting my girlfriend for a run. I try to get it out of the way early, since it makes my day better. Plus, I love spending time with her. I get into the conservatory early, around 9 AM. I bring Mu with me, she loves seeing the students. The secretary doesn't normally get in for another few hours, but my second teacher is just as eager to get into practice as i am. We walk into this modest room, entering right into the staged setup of the group room, then past into respective practice rooms. There's four total, ours are across from each other. It's 12 now. Both of us have ground our brains to a hault. It's lunch and the secretary shows up. We're all happy to see each other. They're grateful for the jobs they have, and I'm grateful to have them there. The secretary starts watering the plants, and the first student shows up. It's the best part of their day. When they come, they feel like they belong. Everything might be weird in the world out there, but everything makes sense when they pick up those sticks. They practiced all wekek to show me what they're about to show me, and I'm super proud of what they've accomplished. That's the fastest I've seen anyone learn The Dance of Eternity. After the last student leaves, around 6, we all ook at each other. Its been a succesful day. We leave feeling generous. I come home with Mu and my girlfriend is cooking dinner. We don't live together, but she sleeps over often. I love her. I haven't told her yet. There's no rush. Tomorrow is New Years, and we'll talk about it then.
