# Q4

## Summary

<!-- Summarize the quarter in 1500 characters or less. -->

This quarter could most accurately be symbolized by the pheonix. I started out in turmoil after having familiarized myself with the teachings of E Myth and The Practice. This sent me into a mental tailspin as I began recognizing the disparage between who I was and who I had to become. Many lessons were learned, primarily those around my continued selfish approach to music and the impact people around me had on me. The recurring themes throughout these periods painted a beautiful narrative arc, starting from a place where I could see how flimsy my structures were, how they hardly housed me and couldn't possibly withold a greater income or more people. Starting once again from the bottom, I began re-building my life over again, this time with generosity in mind from the beginning and with the intention to house others. In doing so, the clutter in my life became more and more unnatractive to the person I was becoming. Among the revelations in this period were my addictions to social media, video games, and masturbation, as well as an awareness of how much I'd lacked disciplined. Through the months, I realigned with more generous and wholesome values, and applied a much greater structure to the way I was living. In doing so (with the aid of Discover Strength) I learned greater discipline, greater perserverance. This led me to starting each day with stronger intentions which resulted in completing nearly all I'd set out to do. This became so addicting that I quit all my addictions in favor of this more rewarding lifestyle. I'm leaving this quarter feeling stressed, but alive and free.
