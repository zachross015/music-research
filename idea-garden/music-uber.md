Finding a way to automate gig booking through Calendly or Fiverr is
going to make it so much easier for people to just book a gig without
all the hassle of reach out. I need to find a reasonable way to do
this. Another really good idea is to make a feedback form with my
criteria (the Benny Greb 6) and their criteria (eg punctuality,
kindness, professionalism, etc) that cater to the market. #marketing
#automation #business #ideas could potentially build this into a gig
app that takes inspiration from bumble/uber. I can kinda imagine it
now, having guarantee statistics to show to the consumer and other
statistics (like average attendance) to the freelancer. Worth looking
into. All of this is mainly to build a good platform for social
proof. #business #automation
