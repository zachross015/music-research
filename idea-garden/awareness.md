like i feel like i see it all
as some sort of obligation rather than a desire which somethines is why it
feels so hard to hang out with JJ or Brandi or anyone is because i view
everything in my life as an obligation rather than something to be genuinely
excited about so its like i constantly want to bail because everyone who has
loved me has forgotten about me has bailed on me has no integrity and has hurt
me all they do is leave me all they do is leave me everyone leaves me no one is
excited to see me thats why i constantly have to mold myself into the version
that they want me to be because if i dont im not good enough if i dont they
will leave me they will abandon me just like my mom did with noah and im
constantly worried that i have to do everything in my power to appease them to
keep them in my life even my inflexibility is a way of neglecting the
clinginess i feel i stick to the plan because i know deep down they want to
bail on me they donnt want to hang out with me no one does why would anyone
want to hang out with me take lessons from me be around me im nothing
absolutely nothing
