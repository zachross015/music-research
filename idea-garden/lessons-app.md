From here, I feel like the best way to further progress is to develop these into SMART goals that her and I can visualize progress on, build an email review that lists progress towards goals. God, the visualization in my head is so fucking cool that I want to include.
- Easy interface for me to create a goal and list quantifiable progress (eg learn 4 songs, update to 1 song after the lesson and show them progress bars that work towards an achievement).  
- Text review for summarizing other things that happened during lesson
- Homework area 
- "Send" or "Save" button that compiles all progress and sends an email which condenses all the progress into a simple view for them. 
  - Feedback button at the bottom
- Eventually also want an interface for them to see these progress markers and overarching goal
- module creation
- Eventually sell the app to other private lessons companies
- Badge creator within app
- Ideally ipad app
- Lesson creator and student manager in app

Putting the review at the end of the email (after the awards) increases chance of survey

Eventually should have this lessons app take them to a website or in app something, ideally we have it celebrate their accomplishments every time they open the app. #lessonsapp

PRIORITIZE. Email list first. Build the app when this works and feels good: as an extension of an existing system. Email should eventually invite them into the app. But getting this end of it to FEEL good is going to require more diligent dreaming and planning than just gettinf ChatGPT to build out the app. It's doing a great job at the infrastructure, but this is going to need more than just a good infrastructure #musicrunna

Log pauses and stops as "Laps" or alternatively option for next exercise #musicrunna #metronome

I feel like music theory should easily become a next option #musicrunna like why isn't there already a Duolingo for music?

Onboarding for #musicrunna should just check if they have a kit or a single pad

Even a basic start to the coaching app would be good. Daily practices served right to someone's phone on a schedule. Can start out with just broadcasting what I'm working on. Integrates well with the metronome app #musicrunna

What is is I want right now with #musicrunna for #teaching?
- Give a "General" idea for homework, list of exercises and suggested amount of work days and times, especially with single day activities
- Allow the student to customize their schedule
- Self-optimization
- Simple interface for creating exercises, achievements
- Automated metronome for going through exercises, create less friction in dilligent practices (automated rest timers)
The thing I want THE MOST right now is to be able to text them a link to a lesson summary/homework breakdown that's essentially a single web page talking about all this information. FUck the email, there's not nearly enough customization there. I want to be able to use this platform to customize my own routines as much as anyone else's


Also, if I can get this up and running, sending something like a weekly practice reccomendation to someone like Caleb would be super good.

#ideas #musicrunna contact books for use of exercises in app 

Should find a condensed way to show the metronome and exercise on the same screen. For most exercises, the net doesn't need to take up the full screen #musicriunna

Eventually use #musicrunna as a research tool give discount to dummies like various finger training and stuff
