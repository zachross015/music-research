From here, I feel like the best way to further progress is to develop these into SMART goals that her and I can visualize progress on, build an email review that lists progress towards goals. God, the visualization in my head is so fucking cool that I want to include.
- Easy interface for me to create a goal and list quantifiable progress (eg learn 4 songs, update to 1 song after the lesson and show them progress bars that work towards an achievement).  
- Text review for summarizing other things that happened during lesson
- Homework area 
- "Send" or "Save" button that compiles all progress and sends an email which condenses all the progress into a simple view for them. 
  - Feedback button at the bottom
- Eventually also want an interface for them to see these progress markers and overarching goal
- module creation
- Eventually sell the app to other private lessons companies
- Badge creator within app
- Ideally ipad app
- Lesson creator and student manager in app

Putting the review at the end of the email (after the awards) increases chance of survey

Eventually should have this lessons app take them to a website or in app something, ideally we have it celebrate their accomplishments every time they open the app. #lessonsapp

PRIORITIZE. Email list first. Build the app when this works and feels good: as an extension of an existing system. Email should eventually invite them into the app. But getting this end of it to FEEL good is going to require more diligent dreaming and planning than just gettinf ChatGPT to build out the app. It's doing a great job at the infrastructure, but this is going to need more than just a good infrastructure #musicrunna

Log pauses and stops as "Laps" or alternatively option for next exercise #musicrunna #metronome

I feel like music theory should easily become a next option #musicrunna like why isn't there already a Duolingo for music?

Onboarding for #musicrunna should just check if they have a kit or a single pad

Even a basic start to the coaching app would be good. Daily practices served right to someone's phone on a schedule. Can start out with just broadcasting what I'm working on. Integrates well with the metronome app #musicrunna

What is is I want right now with #musicrunna for #teaching?
- Give a "General" idea for homework, list of exercises and suggested amount of work days and times, especially with single day activities
- Allow the student to customize their schedule
- Self-optimization
- Simple interface for creating exercises, achievements
- Automated metronome for going through exercises, create less friction in dilligent practices (automated rest timers)
The thing I want THE MOST right now is to be able to text them a link to a lesson summary/homework breakdown that's essentially a single web page talking about all this information. FUck the email, there's not nearly enough customization there. I want to be able to use this platform to customize my own routines as much as anyone else's


Also, if I can get this up and running, sending something like a weekly practice reccomendation to someone like Caleb would be super good.

#ideas #musicrunna contact books for use of exercises in app 

Should find a condensed way to show the metronome and exercise on the same screen. For most exercises, the net doesn't need to take up the full screen #musicriunna

Eventually use #musicrunna as a research tool give discount to dummies like various finger training and stuff

Need to, from the beginning, be capturing analytics on progress. Possibly get Drew on as a content writer? And where does the money come in? Is it monthly subscription, or pay for more time like Duolingo? I think the only problem with Duolingo model is that there's no way for us to challenge people and verify results that way. BUT an offshoot music theory app would be REALLY good under the duolingo model. #musicrunna

Practices should all be easily recordable. #musicrunna

Runna uses a goal oriented system, pick a goal and it structures everything up until that goal. What does that look like for drums? What goals end goals are there?

Onboarding people for general improvement, in any instrument, should just seek to improve ALL technique with daily practices that focus on individual parts. Let drilling into a single concept advance with mastery ie for a guitar student, one day on alternate picking, one on slides, one on chords, etc. For drums, one day on technique, one day on timing, one day on dynamics, etc or alternatively for each sub area (eg technique one day for accents, one for diddles, one for sticking, etc) #musicrunna this is akin to what I did with both working out and the 15 minute a day book, except that book was fixed and this is much more dynamic to the weaknesses of the player

Maybe the way that goal setting works is it tries to create the shortest route? Like if the goal is to get better at uptempo jazz swing, itll take the end goal and end date and customize a routine which should (ideally) guarantee it gets there by customizing practices up until then with a mixture of endurance/sprints #musicrunna

A good goal after I get used to building exercise pattern for people is to get to a point where I input a target for an exercise and the plan auto populates with associated exercises #musicrunna

Definitely need a community tab aspect. Need a way to use this to motivate myself and my friends #musicrunna

On the practice screen, bottom should have a pause/end workout flow. Eventually the "next exercise" button can be included to auto start the next one's timer/met, especially if there's a full screen met this would be good for jumping between exercises after a planned routine. Next should be the summary screen where private notes can go. Main page should have a routine history #musicrunna what of this is absolutely essential for this version? What can be saved?

Pitch grader #musicrunna

Especially with a routine builder, can monetize creators seamlessly through a practice routine marketplace #musicrunna
