From here, I feel like the best way to further progress is to develop these into SMART goals that her and I can visualize progress on, build an email review that lists progress towards goals. God, the visualization in my head is so fucking cool that I want to include.
- Easy interface for me to create a goal and list quantifiable progress (eg learn 4 songs, update to 1 song after the lesson and show them progress bars that work towards an achievement).  
- Text review for summarizing other things that happened during lesson
- Homework area 
- "Send" or "Save" button that compiles all progress and sends an email which condenses all the progress into a simple view for them. 
  - Feedback button at the bottom
- Eventually also want an interface for them to see these progress markers and overarching goal
- module creation
- Eventually sell the app to other private lessons companies
- Badge creator within app
- Ideally ipad app
- Lesson creator and student manager in app

Putting the review at the end of the email (after the awards) increases chance of survey

Eventually should have this lessons app take them to a website or in app something, ideally we have it celebrate their accomplishments every time they open the app. #lessonsapp
