Saying someone's name creates this immediately noticeable impression on them,
but it also creates this genuine feeling of connection within. I've noticed
this a lot at Starbucks where customers that I learned the name of would
immediately start opening up to me--within the first couple of visits--about
their life outside. It also created this much easier way of opening up to them
in return. #insight
