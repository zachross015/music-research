Motivations:
- Often times I am selling a solution to anger, creating calmness through drumming and expression. The environment I am creating is unconciously part of the pitch, that with my teaching they could get to this lifestyle.

Problems:
- Don't know what sticks to buy or what pad to buy, or even to buy them at all. Potential solution: Offer them to beginners during first lesson, or create some document/blog post that guides them through it and shows them what to buy.
