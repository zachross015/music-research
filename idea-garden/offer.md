Motivations:
- Often times I am selling a solution to anger, creating calmness through drumming and expression. The environment I am creating is unconciously part of the pitch, that with my teaching they could get to this lifestyle.

Problems:
- Don't know what sticks to buy or what pad to buy, or even to buy them at all. Potential solution: Offer them to beginners during first lesson, or create some document/blog post that guides them through it and shows them what to buy.

When putting a space together for online, you aren't just selling drum lessons and videos. You're selling/marketing that lifestyle that's given you the space, and you're selling the idea that you have the solutions that will lead someone to that lifestyle #marketing #insights

What did I learn from discover strength today?
- Initiation that went over goal setting was a really good way of easing into the session
  - Could re-instating goals help with my own sales?
- Emphasis on research increased my trust for them
- The 2 free sessions really helped me get involved
- Locking in a social customer (eg me) is good for their marketing

Just mentioning I teach drum lessons perks people who want lessons up (eg Momo talked about it). I need to focus on these people and really sell it to them. Give them a free lesson (with onboarding) then try and get them locked in with everything else. Part of this means I REALLY FUCKING NEED SOCIAL PROOF AND AN ORGANIZED OFFER AND A WAY TO CONGLOMERATE ALL OF IT TOGETHER
