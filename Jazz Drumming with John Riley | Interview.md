John Riley started out playing drums around 8 or 9, mimicking the drummers he had heard on the radio. He originally wanted to go to school for Jazz, but his father wanted him to be a Doctor or Veterinarian. As a compromise, he went to school for classical percussion. 

Most of his teaching skills came from the philosophy that all of the people who came to learn from him were already on their way somehwere. It was just his job to give them the tools to guide themselves where they needed to go. Greats like Bill Stewart were under his tutilge.

Perhaps the most important takeaway was why we study the old jazz drummers. He talks about how we learn to speak from our parents, we start off mimicking the words they say but it isn't until later that they derive any meaning to us. A family of doctor's would have a different language than a family of chefs. Music is unique in that you can choose your parents, you get to choose whose words you mimic until they have meaning. It's because of this that learning music my going back and actively listening to artists, mimicking their feels and fills, is the best way to learn jazz. Tracing back the history of any genre in some way shape or form derives from what the drummers in the 1940's and 1950's were playing. He tlaks of a legend where the rock beat, the straight forward eights instead of swung, was happened upon on accident by a piano player when a drummer messed up a small portion. From then on out, rock was invented which led to Funk and Hip Hop. In the same way that rock drummers should study early rock from John Bonham, Carmen Apice, and Ringo Starr, everyone should go back and learn from the greats. 

There was one other note he discussed where, while reading is often important, it is only supplemental in learning from jazz. This corroborates something from Jazz 101 by John Szwed where listening to old jazz is like reading a textbook. It's is the musical version of reading.
